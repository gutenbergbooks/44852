<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">Preface.</a></h2>
<p>In the history of our national evolution Yorkshire
  occupies a most important position,
  and the sanguinary record of Yorkshire Battles
  possesses something more than material for the
  poet and the artist. Valour, loyalty, patriotism,
  honour and self-sacrifice are virtues not uncommon
  to the warrior, and the blood of true and brave
  men has liberally bedewed our fields.</p>
<p>It was on Yorkshire soil that the tides of
  foreign invasion were rolled back in blood at
  Stamford Bridge and Northallerton; the misfortunes
  attendant upon the reign of weak and
  incapable princes are illustrated by the fields of
  Boroughbridge, Byland Abbey, and Myton-upon-Swale,
  and, in the first days of our greatest
  national struggle, the true men of Yorkshire freely
  shed their blood at Tadcaster, Bradford, Leeds,
  Wakefield, Adwalton Moor and Hull, keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> open the pathway by which Fairfax passed from
  Selby to Marston Moor.</p>
<p>Let pedants prate of wars of kites and crows;
  we take national life as a unity, and dare to face
  its evolution through all the throes of birth, owning
  ourselves debtors to the old times before us,
  without being either so unwise or ungenerous as
  to contemn the bonds of association, and affect a
  false and impossible isolation.</p>
<p>To the educated and intelligent our Yorkshire
  Battles present interesting and important studies
  of those subtle and natural processes by which
  nations achieve liberty, prosperity, and greatness.</p>

<h2>YORKSHIRE BATTLES.</h2>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="I_WINWIDFIELD_Etc" id="I_WINWIDFIELD_Etc">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">WINWIDFIELD, Etc.</span></a></h2>
<p>From the earliest ages of our recorded national
  history the soil of Yorkshire has been
  the &ldquo;dark and bloody ground&rdquo; of mighty chieftains
  and their armed thousands. Where the
  sickle gleams to-day amid the golden fields of
  autumn, our ancestors beheld the flashing steel
  of mighty hosts, and triumphed by the might of
  their red right hand, or endured the bitter humiliation
  of defeat.</p>
<p>Vain was the barrier of Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall to
  restrain the fiery Caledonians from their prey in
  the old times before us, when the Roman Eagle
  was borne above the iron cohorts of the Empire
  through the remote and rugged Northland. When
  Severus visited the island, to maintain his rule
  and quell the raging storms of invasion, he found
  the city of York surrounded by barbarians, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> encountered and drove them afar in bloody defeat
  When the Roman gallies bore off the last of
  the legionaries, and the Britons were left to their
  own resources, the tide of devastation spread wide
  and far, and the suffering people were driven to
  the verge of despair. According to William of
  Malmsbury, the Romans had drained the land of
  its best blood, and left it cursed with a sottish
  and debauched population. Hordes of Picts and
  Scots inundated the land, fired its villages, overthrew
  its cities, and slew the inhabitants with the
  edge of the sword. Oft has the pathetic earnestness
  of Gildas been quoted: &ldquo;The barbarians
  drive us to the sea, the sea throws us back on the
  barbarians; thus two modes of death await us,
  we are either slain or drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the clang of arms and the loud tones of
  war rang through the north, when the White-horse
  Standard of the Saxons was spread upon
  the breeze, and the tall, muscular warriors, with
  their long, fair hair and flowing beards, swept
  towards the borders, filling the Briton with astonishment
  and admiration. Then blood flowed
  like water, and the fiery Picts were turned to
  sullen flight; but, ere long, Yorkshire plain and
  hill groaned under a fresh burden of blood as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> Briton and Saxon strove together for the mastery.
  The tide of war ebbed and flowed around the
  ancient city of York, and sanguinary and numerous
  were the engagements that ensued before
  the Britons relinquished the sovereignty of the
  island.</p>
<p>The history of Edwin, King of Deira and Bernicia,
  is worthy of a passing notice; he was left an
  orphan at the tender age of three years, when
  King Ethelfrith seized his inheritance of Deira,
  and pursued his steps with implacable persistency
  until Redwald King of East Anglia took him
  under his protection. Ethelfrith at once marched
  upon Redwald, and two sanguinary battles followed,
  the usurper perishing in the last conflict.
  Redwald then placed Edwin upon the throne of
  Deira and Bernicia.</p>
<p>Edwin was a pagan, but on espousing the sister
  of Ethelbald, King of Kent, he came under the
  influence of Bishop Paulinus, and his conversion
  followed. On Easter Day, 626, Edwin gave
  audience to his subjects in his &ldquo;regal city&rdquo; on the
  Derwent, a few miles from York. Doubtless it
  was a favourable time for the presenting of petitions,
  for during the night the Queen had given
  birth to a daughter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>Towards the conclusion of the morning&rsquo;s business,
  a messenger was ushered into the royal
  presence, and, when about to address the King,
  drew forth a long double-edged knife, with which
  he attempted to stab the monarch, throwing all
  the weight of his body into the blow. Lila, the
  King&rsquo;s minister, perceiving his master&rsquo;s danger,
  interposed his body, which was transpierced by
  the weapon, which inflicted a slight wound upon
  the King. Upon the instant the assassin
  was slain by a score of weapons, but not before he
  had also killed Forthhere, one of Edwin&rsquo;s household.
  It transpired that the murderer was a
  servant of Cuichelm, king of the West Saxons,
  and was named Eumer. The knife had been
  poisoned, and though robbed of its virulence in
  passing through the body of Lila, the King had
  to endure somewhat at the hands of his physician,
  and was no doubt under some apprehension of
  death. In conversation with Paulinus he vowed
  to accept the Christian religion if he recovered
  from his wound, and succeeded in punishing the
  murderous treachery of Cuichelm, and on Whit-Sunday
  the infant princess received Christian
  baptism.</p>
<p>The avenging army of Northumbria burst into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> the fair Westland with sword and spear, and
  Edwin carried his banner through many a sanguinary
  engagement, when the strong growing
  corn was trampled under foot and cursed with red
  battle-rain, as the massy columns of Northumbria
  drove over the field, banners flapping overhead,
  javelins and stones beating in a terrible shower
  along the front, whilst a forest of portended pikes
  rent and overwhelmed all who dared to brave the
  dreadful onset.</p>
<p>On the King&rsquo;s return he hesitated long before
  professing the Christian religion, and called his
  chiefs to take council with him. To his surprise
  the way was prepared for him. Coifi, chief of the
  pagan priests, doubted the power of his gods. He
  gave them careful service, omitted nothing, and
  deserved well of them, yet he was not first in the
  King&rsquo;s favour, nor prosperous in his undertakings.</p>
<p>One of Edwin&rsquo;s chieftains took a more just and
  elevated view of the subject: &ldquo;The present life of
  man, O King, seems to me, in comparison of
  that time which is unknown to us, like the swift
  flight of a sparrow through the room wherein you
  sit at supper in winter, with your commanders and
  ministers, and a good fire in the midst, whilst
  storms of rain and snow prevail abroad&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> sparrow,
  I say, flying in at one door and immediately out at another, whilst
  he is within, is safe from the wintry storm; but after a short
  space of fair weather, he immediately vanishes
  out of your sight, into the dark winter from which
  he had emerged. So this life of man appears for a
  short space, but of what went before, or what is to
  follow, we are utterly ignorant. If, therefore, this
  new doctrine contains something more certain, it
  seems justly to deserve to be followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result was that Coifi undertook to desecrate
  his gods, assuming sword and spear, and
  mounting a stallion, forbidden to priests. Great
  was the astonishment and awe of the people as
  the royal party rode towards the temple. As Coifi
  approached he brandished his spear, and hurled it
  into the building. As it clashed upon the floor an
  awful cry burst from the priests, but no dire
  catastrophe followed, and fire being applied to the
  temple, building and gods were alike consumed.
  The impotence of the pagan gods established, the
  conversion of the people rapidly followed, and
  the wise and good King reigned over a flourishing
  state for several years.</p>
<p>Unhappily, the virtues of the King and the
  affection of his subjects were no protection from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> misfortune, and the chequered life went down
  in ruin and defeat. Penda, the pagan King of
  Mercia, a wretch inured to crime, entered into
  a confederacy with Cadwalla, King of North
  Wales, and, after vowing to compass the destruction
  of all the Christians in the island, marched
  against King Edwin.</p>
<p>The royal Northumbrian was neither slow to
  mass his troops nor meet his arch-enemy; but
  the triumph that had so often attended his arms
  was not vouchsafed in this inauspicious hour;
  and when the terrible waves of battle rolled
  against each other at the village of Hatfield,
  near Doncaster, in the October days of 633,
  his throne and crown went down in the fierce
  storm, though brave men flung themselves before
  his banners, and struggled with the savage foe
  as long as life lingered in the hacked and bleeding
  frame.</p>
<p>Falling with honour in the van of battle, Edwin
  breathed out his life amidst the roar of the contending
  hosts, and so the day darkened ere the
  night closed on Christian Northumbria. By the
  King&rsquo;s side fell his son, the gallant young Osfrid,
  and the slaughter of the defeated army being very
  great, a season of extreme depression ensued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> Great as the confusion was, the dead King received
  the last melancholy offices, his head being
  buried in the porch of the church at York, and
  the Abbey at Whitby receiving his body.</p>
<p>In the year 655, when the winters of eighty
  years had bleached the head of the warlike and
  ferocious Penda, he again participated in a tremendous
  conflict which took place on the Field of
  Victory, or Winwidfield, on the northern bank of
  the Aire, near Leeds. The occasion of the war
  was as follows: Adelwald, King of Deira, was
  threatened by Oswy, King of Bernicia, and perceiving
  that he could only hope to retain his
  crown by compassing the ruin of that powerful
  monarch, he formed a league with the Kings of
  Mercia and East Anglia, and declared war against
  Oswy, who, dismayed by so powerful a coalition,
  strove, by every possible means, to avert the
  bursting of the storm. All his efforts proving
  futile, he humbled himself in fervent supplications
  for victory on the solemn eve of the impending
  battle, and recorded a religious vow that, in the
  event of his being delivered from his enemies, his
  infant daughter, Elfleda, should be devoted to the
  service of the Holy Church. While Oswy was
  buried in supplication the shrewd brain of Adelwald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> was busily revolving the position. Should
  Oswy be defeated, he would be at the mercy
  of his allies of Mercia and East Anglia, and his
  own destruction and the division of his kingdom
  might be anticipated. To obviate such a disastrous
  result Adelwald resolved to reserve his own
  forces, and leave his allies to deal with Oswy,
  when he might reasonably hope to secure his
  kingdom against the decimated army, or armies
  of the victor. On the morning of the 15th of
  November, the four Kings marshalled their forces,
  spearmen, and other variously armed infantry
  and cavalry; and Penda, animated and impetuous,
  his fiery spirit undimmed by the four score years
  that had passed over his head, rushed to the
  attack, and the clash of arms and tumult of war
  resounded over the field as the troops of Oswy
  nobly sustained the fierce assault. At this juncture,
  the crafty Adelwald, assured that the deadly
  game would be continued to the bitter end, began
  to retire his troops, and the Mercians, losing
  heart under the suspicion of his treachery, relaxed
  their efforts, and commenced a hasty and confused
  retreat. Penda and his numerous chieftains appealed
  to them, and strove to restore their broken
  ranks, but in vain. Oswy pressed them hard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> smote them with fierce charges of cavalry, and
  with the rush of his serried spearmen bore down
  all resistance. The Kings of Anglia and East
  Mercia were put to the sword, and their armies
  decimated and scattered. Oswy, secured in the
  possession of life and throne, exulted in the
  signal victory which had blessed his arms. Amid
  the lifeless thousands that encumbered the sanguinary
  field, twenty-eight vassal chieftains of the
  highest rank had fallen with their Kings.</p>
<p>Oswy satiated his regal ambition by taking
  possession of the realms of his conquered adversaries,
  but he respected the crown of the crafty
  Adelwald, who retained the glittering bauble until
  his death, a few years later.</p>
<p>Before the Saxon monarchy had time to develope,
  the Danes visited the unhappy island with
  fire and sword. Coasting along the shores, interrupting
  the commerce, blocking up the mouths of
  the rivers, or penetrating far inland, their only
  mission to plunder and destroy, they proved a
  terrible curse to the nation, and brought the
  islanders to the verge of ruin and despair.</p>
<p>With the name of Penda, is associated that of a
  very opposite Prince, Alfred, King of the Northumbrians,
  as he is styled in the Anglo-Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> Chronicle. Alfred espoused Kyneburga, Penda&rsquo;s
  daughter, by whom he had issue one son, Osred,
  who succeeded to the throne.</p>
<p>This talented Prince ascended the throne after
  many vicissitudes, and was slain at Ebberston
  on the 19th January, 705, and was buried in the
  church of Little Driffield. It appears that the
  country was being ravaged by a large body of
  Danes and Norwegians, and that Alfred pursued
  and engaged them, holding them to a desperate
  trial of arms for the whole of the short winter&rsquo;s
  afternoon. The gloomy night was closing in
  on the dreadful scene, and the Northmen were
  breaking before the charges of the royal troops,
  when an arrow smote the King, and he fell in
  the front of battle. On the instant a Danish
  warrior charged the prostrate monarch, and, before
  a hand could be raised in his defence, wounded
  him in the thigh. In haste and confusion the
  wounded man was carried away from the scene of
  strife, and concealed in a cave until the invaders
  had retired, when he was borne to the castle of
  Deira-field, and every attention given to recover
  him from his wounds, but after a week of suffering
  he expired, to the regret of his subjects.</p>
<p>In the year 867, a great conflict for the sovereignty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> of Northumbria was maintained between
  Osbert and Ella, the former having been expelled
  from his throne and the latter elected thereto
  in his stead. At this unhappy juncture, the
  Danish chieftains, Hinguar and Hubba, brought a
  powerful fleet into the Humber, and therewith
  passed their land forces over the river into Northumbria,
  directing the march of their principal
  forces upon York, and marking their track in
  blood and ashes. The common danger arrested
  the course of the internecine feud, and Osbert
  and Ella proposed to combine their forces for the
  defence of the capital. Before this junction
  could, however, be effected the Northmen fell
  upon York, and Osbert, without waiting for his
  ally, threw himself into the city, and attacked
  the advancing Danes. For a time the battle
  raged hotly. The banners were brought to the
  front, and the leaders fought gallantly beneath
  them, animating their followers by their example
  and exhortations. So fierce was the defence
  of the Northumbrians that the Danes were driven
  back, but only to again struggle forward through
  dust and blood to the devoted city. Osbert and
  his chieftains strove nobly to hold up against
  the heavy masses that bore down upon them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> such determined energy. Again and again they
  cast themselves upon the steel-bound ranks of
  their enemies, only to be borne down in the press,
  before the descending swords, and lie beneath the
  feet that pressed forward and entered the city
  in triumph. Scarcely had Hubba and Hinguar
  established themselves, before Ella approached,
  and addressed himself to the storming of the
  walls. So fierce and stubborn was the onslaught,
  that his troops broke through the defences and
  penetrated the Danish lines. The Northman was
  never more to be feared than when at bay, with
  the sword above his head. The Danes sallied
  out, slew or drove out all the Northumbrians who
  had entered the city, and, engaging them in
  the open field, put Ella and the flower of his
  army to the sword. The day was fittingly concluded
  by a fiendish massacre of the citizens of
  York.</p>
<p>In Saxon and Danish times Northumbria was
  continually invaded, and in the days of King
  Athelstan the famous battle of Brunanburgh was
  fought north of the Humber, and, if we may
  attach any importance to the speculations of some
  of our Yorkshire antiquaries, our favoured county
  was the scene of that desperate conflict. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> matter of fact, the exact locality of the battle has
  not yet been established on sufficient evidence,
  and no doubt our historians will continue to
  regard it as unascertained.</p>

<h2><a name="II_BATTLE_OF_STAMFORD_BRIDGE" id="II_BATTLE_OF_STAMFORD_BRIDGE">II.&mdash;BATTLE OF STAMFORD BRIDGE.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1066.</h3>
<p>Two circumstances secured the triumph of
  William, Duke of Normandy, when he invaded
  Saxon England in the year 1066. The
  first was the temporary withdrawal of the Saxon
  fleet, for the purpose of securing supplies; the
  second was the enmity of Tosti Godwinsson, who
  incited Harold Hardrada to attempt the subjugation
  of the island. Had the Saxon fleet kept
  the sea, had Harold encountered the invader with
  the unbroken strength of his army of defence, the
  Norman might have effected a landing, but it
  would have been with decimated forces, and
  probably in the face of an army that would have
  offered a desperate resistance to their disembarkation,
  and would have called them to an even more
  bloody conflict than that of Senlac.</p>
<p>The chain of events which led to the Battle of
  Stamford Bridge may be traced back to that
  memorable scene when the aged and heroic
  Northumbrian, Jarl Siward, lay dying in his house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> at York. Disdaining to meet death in other
  than his customary guise of warrior and chief,
  he caused his servitors to invest his gigantic
  frame in the iron panoply of war, to arm him with
  the heavy sword and tempered battle-axe which
  he had so long and ably employed in the national
  service, and so breathed his last, leaving the wild
  hordes of Northumbria to be disposed of by King
  Edward, for his son, the afterwards far-famed
  Waltheof, was too young to rule over so extensive
  and warlike a province. No doubt Harold employed
  his great influence with King Edward
  to secure the aggrandisement of his own family,
  for his brother Tosti was invested with command
  of the province.</p>
<p>Tosti was the most froward of the sons of
  Godwin, and showed none of the high qualities
  and sincere patriotism which distinguished Godwin
  and his son Harold.</p>
<p>Cruel and passionate, Tosti was ill-fitted to
  govern a proud and inflammable people like the
  Northumbrians. The following passage from
  Roger of Wendover illustrates the violent disposition
  of the Earl: &ldquo;Tosti quitted the King&rsquo;s
  court in a rage, and coming to the city of Hereford,
  where his brother Harold had prepared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> great
  feast for the King, he cut off the limbs of all the servants, and put
  an arm, or some other member, in each of the vessels of wine, mead,
  ale, or pickle; after which he sent a message to the
  King, that on coming to his lodgings, he would
  find the food seasoned to his mind, and that he
  should take care to carry away the delicacies
  with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tosti&rsquo;s rule in Northumbria came to a sudden
  termination, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1065. The &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&rdquo;
  thus records the event: &ldquo;All the thanes
  in Yorkshire and Northumberland gathered themselves
  together, and outlawed their Earl, Tosty,
  and slew his household men, all that they might
  come at, as well English as Danish: and they
  took all his weapons at York, and gold and silver,
  and all his treasures which they might anywhere
  there hear of, and sent after Morkar, the son of
  Elgar the Earl, and chose him to be their Earl:
  and he went south with all the shire, and with
  Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire, and Lincolnshire,
  until he came to Northampton: and his
  brother Edwin came to meet him with the men
  who were in his earldom, and also many Britons
  came with him. There came Harold, the Earl,
  to meet them; and they laid an errand upon him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> to
  King Edward, and also sent messengers with him, and begged that they
  might have Morkar for their Earl. And the King granted it, and sent
  Harold again to them at Northampton, on the eve
  of St. Simon&rsquo;s and St. Jude&rsquo;s Mass; and he
  made known the same to them, and delivered a
  pledge thereof to them: and he there renewed
  Canute&rsquo;s law. But the northern men did much
  harm about Northampton whilst he went on their
  errand, inasmuch as they slew men and burned
  houses and corn; and took all the cattle which
  they came at, that was many thousand: and
  many hundred men they took and led north with
  them; so that shire, and the other shires which
  there are nigh, were for many years the worse.
  And Tosty the earl, and his wife, and all those
  who would what he would, went south over sea
  with him to Baldwin, the earl, and he received
  them all; and they were all the winter there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The indignation of Tosti was extreme, and was
  not unnaturally directed towards his brother,
  Harold, who had used his influence with the Confessor
  to obtain the pardon of the turbulent
  Northumbrians, and the confirmation of Morkar
  in the possession of the earldom. That Harold
  was actuated by personal motives cannot be questioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> for he procured the government of Mercia
  for Earl Edwin, and espoused the sister of these
  potent nobles. It was obvious that a crisis must
  come in his history, and in that of his country, and
  as a man and a patriot he could not afford to be
  hampered by the crimes of his brother, and by the
  disaffection and revolt of a province so remote
  and difficult of access as Northumbria. Although
  Harold was at the head of an army when he
  treated with the Northumbrians at Northampton,
  it is apparent from the passage already quoted
  that they were assembled in such numbers and
  array, that any attempt to reinstate Tosti in the
  earldom would have resulted in a battle, and
  probably would have necessitated an armed invasion
  of Northumbria.</p>
<p>On the 5th of January, 1066, King Edward
  fulfilled the number of his days, and on the morrow
  was buried in Westminster Abbey. From
  the day of his death England entered upon a
  long course of stormy and disastrous years; and
  it must be confessed that to his own folly in
  promising the succession to his kinsman, William,
  Duke of Normandy, the national troubles are to
  be largely attributed. It is said that Edward&rsquo;s
  last hours were vexed by the vision of a warrior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> shooting a bloody arrow, portending evil days for
  the Kingdom; and also that he gave a reluctant
  consent to the succession of Harold, warning him
  that the result would be very grevious.</p>
<p>The citizens of London, the nobility, and clergy,
  were largely favourable to the claims of Harold;
  the lineal heir to the crown being the Confessor&rsquo;s
  nephew, Edgar Atheling&mdash;a youth of far
  too tender years to wear the crown to which
  the Duke of Normandy and Harold Godwinson
  aspired. No man wished to behold the Norman
  duke seated upon the throne of the great Alfred;
  and when Harold caused himself to be proclaimed
  king on the evening of the day of the Confessor&rsquo;s
  death, his action was ratified by the Witenagemot,
  and the crown was placed upon his head
  by Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p>In the North alone was any disaffection manifested
  towards King Harold, and he met it by
  paying the Northumbrians a visit, in which he
  was accompanied by Wulstan, Bishop of Worcester.
  He was favourably received, and won the
  esteem and support of the Northumbrians.</p>
<p>In the true sense of the word, Harold was an
  elected king, chosen of the nation; not a tyrant
  and usurper.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>Earl Tosti spared no pains to raise up enemies
  against his brother during the period of his
  enforced banishment, and succeeded in inducing
  the famous Norwegian monarch, Harold Hardrada,
  to make a descent upon the island. Too
  impatient to await the appearance of his ally,
  Earl Tosti was the first to raise sword in the
  land, coming from beyond sea with a fleet
  of daring adventurers, Flemings, and others.
  Landing in the Isle of Wight, he enforced contributions
  of food and money, and proceeded to
  ravage the coast as far as Sandwich. Harold
  had, however, provided so largely for the protection
  of his Kingdom by the formation of a
  large fleet, and of formidable land forces, that
  Tosti was compelled to beat a speedy retreat,
  and directed his course to the North, taking
  &ldquo;some of the boatmen with him, some willingly
  and some unwillingly.&rdquo; Entering the Humber,
  he devastated the Lindsey shore with fire and
  sword; but being beset by the troops of Morkar
  and Edwin, he was deserted by the greater part
  of his fleet, and was obliged to precipitately retire
  into Scotland with the twelve gallies that remained
  to him. King Malcolm III. hospitably
  entertained the fugitive prince at his court, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> all the solicitations of Tosti failed to induce him
  to invade the territories of King Harold. Tosti
  succeeded in attaching a number of adventurers to
  his cause, or rather a number of pirates followed
  his fortunes in the hope of obtaining plunder, and
  with the certainty of being allowed to slaughter
  the inhabitants of the coasts, and to ravage the
  land.</p>
<p>Where the North Sea foams around the Orkneys,
  Tosti was to meet the Norwegian monarch;
  and the Orkneyinga Saga thus narrates his arrival
  and departure:&mdash;&ldquo;At this time, when the brothers,
  Paul and Erlendr, had taken up the rule in
  Orkney, there arrived at the east side of the
  island from Norway Harold Sigurdson with a
  large army. He came first to Shetland. Went
  from thence to Orkney. There he left Queen
  Ellisif, and their daughters, Maria and Ingigerdi.
  From Orkney he had much help. Both the jarls
  joined the expedition of the king. The king
  thence went south to England, and landed where
  it is called Klifland, and came to Skardaborg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tosti and his gallies joined the Norwegians,
  and in the expressive phraseology of the time:&mdash;&ldquo;Tosti
  submitted to him and became his man.&rdquo;
  Northumbria was the seat of war, the Saxon fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> and Harold&rsquo;s army of defence being located in
  the South, for the arrival of the armament of
  the Duke of Normandy was daily expected, and
  Tosti and his ally had therefore every prospect
  of obtaining a strong hold of the North, the
  population of which was largely of Danish origin.</p>
<p>From the first the proceedings of the invaders
  were not calculated to win over the Northumbrians
  to their cause. As the great fleet of 500
  sail bore for the Humber, numerous troops were
  landed to ravage the coast; and a fierce swoop
  was made upon Scarborough, which was burnt
  to the ground. Sailing up the Humber, the
  invaders continued their evil work, and the sky
  was lurid with flame and dark with smoke, and
  slaughtered peasants were strewn on the soil
  which they had ploughed and sown in the earlier
  days of the year, when they looked forward to
  the harvest of the scythe and sickle, nor dreamt
  that Autumn would bring upon them the sharp
  chastisement of the sword.</p>
<p>York was the prize for which the invaders
  offered, and, sailing up the Ouse, they moored
  their fleet at the village of Riccall, ten miles
  from the city, upon which they at once directed
  their march. Jarls Edwin and Morkar made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> strenuous efforts to arrest the invaders, but the
  northern forces were insufficient to meet so numerous
  and powerful an army as that of Hardrada.
  Nevertheless, the brothers assembled such troops
  as they could collect, and took up a position at
  Fulford to cover the city. Hardrada occupied
  a defensive position, with the river on his right
  flank, and a morass on his left. Edwin and
  Morkar showed no lack of spirit in the combat
  which ensued, and promptly charged the Norwegian
  lines, which they penetrated, making a
  very great slaughter; but being too weak in numbers
  to reap the full advantage of their valour,
  they were unable to rout the ranks which they
  had thrown into disorder; and the Norwegians
  clung to their ground, and maintained a hand-to-hand
  conflict until the arrival of large reinforcements
  from the fleet enabled them to push
  back the Northumbrian ranks, and to charge
  them in turn. This was decisive of the battle:
  the Northumbrians had exhausted their strength
  in the first conflict, and could not stem the tide
  of fresh warriors that bore down upon them,
  with their ringing war-song, and with flashing
  spears and axes. The disordered ranks of the
  Northumbrians were speedily broken, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> army dissolved in a wild rout of savage fugitives,
  oft turning stubbornly at bay, and exacting
  a heavy price for their lives. Many of the
  Northumbrians were forced into the river, or
  took to the water in their endeavours to escape
  the vengeance of the unsparing Norwegians, so
  that more men of the Saxon army perished
  in the Ouse than fell by the sword on the field
  of Fulford. &ldquo;And this fight was on the vigil of
  St. Matthew the apostle, and it was Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morkar and Edwin retired into York with the
  remnant of fugitives that rallied around them;
  but their numbers were insufficient for the defence
  of the city, and they retreated thence, when
  Harold and Tosti entered in triumph at the
  head of a division of their army, and received
  the submission of the citizens, who furnished
  them with provisions, and placed hostages in their
  hands; &ldquo;and they agreed upon a full peace, so
  that they should all go with him south, and this
  land subdue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Norwegians had retired from the city, and
  taken up a position at Stamford Bridge, part of
  the army remaining at Riccall for the protection
  of the fleet, while the commanders appear to
  have been engaged in projects for organising an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> army to march south; but the enemy was approaching
  by forced marches; and on the 26th
  of September, 1066, the decisive battle of Stamford
  Bridge was fought</p>
<p>No sooner was Harold apprised of the invasion
  of Northumbria, than he placed himself at the
  head of his army, advanced his ensigns; and
  pressed forward with such celerity that, on the
  23rd of September, his army occupied Tadcaster.
  On the following day he entered York; the
  Norwegians, who had been left in occupation,
  retiring before him. The battle commenced at
  sunrise on the 25th; and the forces of Harold
  and Tosti appear to have been taken by surprise,
  for a large number of Norwegians were with
  the fleet at Riccall. Under any circumstances,
  however, Hardrada was certain to provide for
  the safety of his fleet; and the fact that he
  afterwards drew large reinforcements from it does
  not of itself imply that he was taken by surprise,
  unless, indeed he had under-estimated the forces of
  Harold, and had prepared for battle accordingly.</p>
<p>The armies were sufficiently powerful for so
  important an occasion, each consisting of some
  60,000 men; those of Hardrada being adventurers
  and soldiers by profession; whilst the warlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> element was sufficiently developed in Harold&rsquo;s
  army, many of the troops being veterans, and all
  accustomed to wield arms, for there had not been
  time to collect hasty levies, such as some of
  those that fought at Hastings three weeks later.</p>
<p>Before the battle commenced, Harold Godwinson
  dispatched a troop of twenty horse to
  negotiate with the enemy, no doubt in the hope
  of winning over his brother Tosti, against whom
  his mind revolted from engaging in war. Tosti
  manifested a marked disposition to accede to his
  brother&rsquo;s wishes on being informed that he
  should be reinstated in his territories and honours;
  but, on his demanding what price would
  be paid to secure his ally, Harold Sigurdson, he
  was met by the significant reply:&mdash;&ldquo;Six feet of
  earth; or, as he is a giant, he shall have seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Tosti swore a great oath that no man
  should ever say that Tosti, son of Godwin, broke
  faith with Harold, son of Sigurd; whereon the
  trumpets sounded, and the Saxon advance began.</p>
<p>The Norwegians occupied a purely defensive
  position on rising ground in the rear of the Derwent;
  the narrow wooden bridge, which spanned
  the river, being held by a strong detachment
  posted on the Saxon side of the water. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> is a strange legendary story told of a gigantic
  Norwegian holding the bridge, single-handed,
  against the Saxon army for three hours; meeting
  every rush of the assailants with tremendous
  blows of a huge battle-axe, and only falling by
  a treacherous blow from the spear of a Saxon
  soldier, who, in a boat, passed underneath the
  bridge, and directing a stroke of his spear between
  the planks, smote the warrior underneath
  his mail, and so slew him. Considering that
  Harold&rsquo;s army contained both archers and slingers,
  it is difficult to believe that three hours should
  be lost, and forty Saxons slain by this terrible
  warrior, before he fell to the cowardly stroke of
  a concealed enemy.</p>
<p>It is certain, however, that the bridge was
  stormed by the Saxons, and that Harold Hardrada
  maintained a defensive position while they
  crossed, although he might have attacked them
  at great disadvantage while forming in the open
  ground. Being deficient in cavalry, he had
  formed his troops somewhat in the old Scottish
  fashion of the Schiltron: massing them in one
  huge circular column, with the front rank kneeling,
  and all presenting their pikes, so that the
  bristling column might scarcely be broken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> the most desperate and repeated charges, and
  the soldiers, who loved fighting with the wild
  Norse love, which has not yet died out of the
  earth, might safely count upon a feast of blows
  that day.</p>
<p>Hardrada occupied the centre of his army,
  with his jarls and captains around him, and his
  famous war-standard, the &ldquo;Land-Ravager,&rdquo; floating
  above his head. He was mounted upon a
  powerful black war-horse, his hauberk and helmet
  were of burnished steel, and a long blue cloak
  rendered him conspicuous amidst his warlike
  thousands, over whom he towered in the physical
  superiority of his gigantic stature; as the
  battle commenced he lifted his powerful voice,
  and sang his war-song, kindling the enthusiasm
  of his warriors, and preparing them for the storm
  that was about to burst upon them.</p>
<p>Before the main-battle commenced, the force
  that guarded the bridge had to be driven back,
  and if there be any truth in the story of its
  sturdy defence, Hardrada&rsquo;s reinforcements should
  have reached him before the Saxons passed the
  bridge.</p>
<p>The initiative was forced upon Harold Godwinson,
  and no slackness was shown by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> Saxons in closing in upon their formidable adversaries.
  The charges were repeated again and
  again, and the famous Saxon twibil did good
  service that day; nor were the spearmen wanting
  in their efforts, while the Saxon cavalry charged
  again and again. The day wore on; the cries
  of battle and the clash of weapons sounded far;
  the Norwegian host was belted by a wide hem
  of the dead. The Saxon light troops did good
  service on this memorable day, and brought down
  many of the sea-rovers by the discharge of their
  missiles. Although both armies suffered severely,
  the battle endured steadily; the invaders maintained
  their formation with stubborn valour, and
  the Saxons continued their attacks with equal
  determination. In the heat of the battle an
  arrow smote King Hardrada in the throat, and
  he died in the midst of his army, at the foot of
  his standard, to the sound of ringing steel and
  fierce war-cries.</p>
<p>Although the noble form of Hardrada was
  missed from the press, and his war-cry no longer
  presaged victory to the Norwegian host, his valiant
  troops maintained the field with unabated
  ardour; and Prince Olave bringing up reinforcements
  from the fleet, the strife waxed fiercer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> and the most sanguine might question with whom
  the victory would rest. Harold was an expert
  warrior, and failing to penetrate the Norwegian
  ranks by dint of hard fighting, he feigned a
  retreat, and induced them to abandon their close
  formation, in the excitement of attack and pursuit,
  when he turned upon their disordered lines, and
  the field instantly became the scene of a fierce
  hand-to-hand encounter, with its dreadful attendant
  carnage. Tosti, and many of the Norwegians,
  fell in the last stubborn effort to maintain
  the field, for although the generous Saxon offered
  them quarter, it was disdainfully refused by the
  maddened Northmen.</p>
<p>The following quaint and pithy account of the
  battle is taken from the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&rdquo;
  and is well worthy of quotation:&mdash;&ldquo;Then, during
  this, came Harold, King of the Angles, with all
  his forces, on the Sunday, to Tadcaster, and there
  drew up his force, and went thence on Monday
  throughout York; and Harold, King of Norway,
  and Tosty, the Earl, and their forces, were gone
  from their ships beyond York to Stamford-bridge,
  because it had been promised them for a certainty,
  that there, from all the shire, hostages should be
  brought to meet them. Then came Harold, King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> of
  the English, against them, unawares, beyond the bridge, and they there
  joined battle, and very strenuously, for a long time of the day, continued
  fighting: and there was Harold King of
  Norway and Tosty the Earl slain, and numberless
  of the people with them, as well of the
  Northmen as of the English: and the Northmen
  fled from the English. Then was there one
  of the Norwegians who withstood the English
  people, so that they might not pass over the
  bridge, nor obtain the victory. Then an Englishman
  aimed at him with a javelin, but it availed
  nothing; and then came another under the
  Bridge, and pierced him terribly inwards under
  the coat of mail. Then came Harold, King of
  the English, over the bridge, and his forces onward
  with him, and there made great slaughter,
  as well of Norwegians as of Flemings. And
  the King&rsquo;s son Edmund, Harold let go home
  to Norway, with all the ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dreadful were the events of that September
  day, and most dismally tragic the retreat from
  Stamford Bridge to Riccall; the pursuers wielding
  sword and spear with merciless energy on the
  rear of the fugitive army, while ever and anon the
  Northman turned upon his foe and died fighting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>The fleet was reached by the war-worn Norwegians,
  but afforded them no refuge, for the
  Saxons pressed on to the attack, and captured
  ship after ship, and in some instances appear to
  have fired the vessels, failing to carry them by
  the sword, for the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&rdquo;
  says:&mdash;&ldquo;And the English from behind hotly
  smote them, until they came, some to their
  ships, some were drowned, and some also burned;
  and thus in divers ways they perished, so that
  there were few left. The King then gave his
  protection to Olave, son of the King of the Norwegians,
  and to their bishop and to the Earl of
  Orkney, and to all those who were left in the
  ships: and they then went up to our King, and
  swore oaths that they ever would observe peace
  and friendship toward this land, and the King
  let them go home with twenty-four ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the low plain of Riccall the dead lay thickly,
  and to this day the villagers point out to the
  curious visitor the huge earthen mounds that
  cover the bones of the Norwegians.</p>
<p>The Harold Hardrada Saga gives us a last
  glimpse of the remnant of the forlorn fleet, as
  it sailed from the ancient port of Ravenser:&mdash;&ldquo;Olafr,
  son of Harold Sigurdson, led the fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> from
  England, setting sail at Hrafnseyri, and in the autumn came to Orkney.

<p>The memory of the Norwegian giant who held
  the bridge was perpetuated by the people of
  Stamford, for Drake tells us that they &ldquo;have a
  custom, at an annual feast, to make pies in the
  form of a swill, or swine tub, which tradition says
  was made use of by the man who struck the
  Norwegian on the bridge, instead of a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold is accused of having disgusted his army
  by refusing them a share of the spoil; but this is
  difficult to reconcile with the known generous
  character of the man; and no prince could have
  been more nobly seconded by his troops than
  was Harold on the field of Senlac.</p>
<p>Brief indeed was the victor&rsquo;s respite from the
  dangers of the field; for, as he was presiding at
  a great feast of his chieftains and officers at York,
  a messenger entered the hall in haste, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> delivered his ominous message that William of Normandy
  had disembarked his army at Pevensey,
  unopposed, on the 29th of September.</p>
<p>The march south was at once commenced; and
  on the 14th of October a murderous battle was
  fought at Senlac, raging with unwavering fury
  from sunrise to sunset. King Harold, his brothers
  Leofwin and Gurth, fell in the front of battle,
  with the flower of the army; and from that day
  the Norman rule commenced in England.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="III_AFTER_STAMFORD_BRIDGE" id="III_AFTER_STAMFORD_BRIDGE">III.&mdash;AFTER STAMFORD BRIDGE.</a></h2>
<p>William, Duke of Normandy, landed at
  Pevensey on the eve of St. Michael,
  1066, and cast up fortifications for the protection
  of his army. Not venturing to penetrate into the
  country, he awaited the approach of the Saxon
  army. He had not long to wait. The route from
  York to Hastings was covered by forced marches,
  and, with a decimated and wearied army, Harold
  Godwinson took up his position before the Norman
  host. His rear was protected by rising
  ground; his front and flanks by trenches and
  huge wooden piles. He had especially to fear
  the Norman cavalry and archers, and took every
  precaution to defend his troops against them.</p>
<p>On the eve of the battle the Saxons regaled
  themselves with strong ale, and chanted legendary
  songs by their bivouac fires; but the Normans
  occupied themselves in religious services, as befitted
  hired cut-throats and the &ldquo;scum of Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s banner, embroidered in gold with the
  figure of a warrior, in battle attitude, was fixed
  near the &ldquo;hoar apple tree.&rdquo; The men of Wessex
  brought with them their great banner, emblazoned
  with a golden dragon.</p>
<p>On the 14th October, Harold&rsquo;s birthday, the
  battle was fought. The Norman army advanced
  in three lines: the light infantry and archers
  under Roger de Montgomerie; the men-at-arms
  under Martel; and the knights, esquires, and
  picked men-at-arms under the command of the
  Duke.</p>
<p>As the Normans advanced they raised the song
  of Roland, and the minstrel Taillefer claimed first
  blood, as a sturdy Saxon fell to his sword.</p>
<p>The Norman archers shot their arrows fast
  and well, point-blank against the Saxons, but the
  palisades proved a most efficient protection, and
  from their bows, and slings, and military machines,
  the Saxons replied, but they were not famous in
  missile warfare. Then the Norman lines closed
  on front and flanks, with thrust of lance, and fierce
  axe-play against the stout wooden piles, and all
  the while the heavy Saxon twibils rose and fell,
  crashing through Norman helm and shield, as
  horse and rider bit the dust, and from the Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> rear the heavy javelins came whirling through
  the air. The dead and wounded lay thick on
  both sides of the palisades, and blood trickled
  and curdled in the dust. With unflinching courage
  the conflict was maintained, amid a tumult of
  discordant sounds: the clash and clatter of steel
  against steel, the groans of the wounded, and the
  sudden death-yells of those whose spirits fled as
  the axes came crashing through helm and brain-pan,
  or lance was driven sheer through corset
  and breast: above the heat and roar of the <i>melee</i> pealed the Saxon war-cry: &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s Rood! the
  Holy Rood!&rdquo; answered by the sonorous Norman
  death-cry: &ldquo;Our lady of help! God be our
  help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day sped to the heat and languor of the
  mid October noon, and the Normans toiled before
  the Saxon front, and belted it with flashing steel.</p>
<p>With painful anxiety Duke William saw his
  repeated charges spent against the Saxon army,
  saw his ranks shaken and thinned, without one
  foot of ground being won. He now bade his
  archers shoot high in the air, so that their
  arrows might descend upon the heads of the
  Saxons. By this the slaughter was dreadfully
  increased within the Saxon lines, but the warriors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> were unshaken in their resolution to maintain
  their ground.</p>
<p>Along the front the Saxons nobly avenged
  their slaughtered brethren, and William poured
  his whole army against them in a murderous
  charge. Quicker rose and fell the Saxon axes,
  and, recoiling from the shock, the surging mass
  of mail-clad warriors rolled down the ravine, between
  two hills, and many men were trampled
  to death by the struggling horses. Surely a
  charge of heavy cavalry would, at this crisis,
  have secured the throne and crown of Harold.
  Thrice the stalwart form of Norman William
  sank amid the surges, as three horses were slain
  beneath him. A cry arose that the Duke was
  slain, and panic and defeat appeared inevitable,
  when William rode, bare-headed, among his warriors,
  and reformed their ranks.</p>
<p>During the dreadful carnage, Harold maintained
  the van, fighting with heroic courage, although
  suffering severely from an arrow-wound which
  had destroyed one of his eyes. William&rsquo;s strenuous
  efforts were nobly seconded by his officers,
  and especially by his half-brother, Odo, the warlike
  bishop of Bayeux. Foiled in every attempt
  to penetrate the Saxon lines, and hopeless of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> beating them out of their defences, William drew
  the Saxons by a feigned retreat of his cavalry,
  and on passing the broken ground, turned upon
  them, and cut them to pieces. Twice was the
  ruse repeated, and although the Saxons maintained
  their position with undaunted front, their
  ranks were terribly thinned and shaken.</p>
<p>The charges were repeated, again and again,
  and the Normans rolled back in blood. The day
  waned, but the desperate attacks were foiled. At
  length a number of palisades were displaced, and
  the Norman horse bit into the Saxon masses,
  hewing a bloody pathway, and paying heavily for
  every foot they won. Twenty knights vowed to
  take Harold&rsquo;s banner, and William of Normandy,
  rendered desperate by his peril, was anxiously
  seeking the Saxon hero. The conflict inside the
  palisades was tremendous. Harold&rsquo;s brothers,
  Gurth and Leofwin, perished in the van: the
  King was slain; there was a bloody rally round
  the royal banner; ten of the Norman knights
  were hewn down, but the banner was captured,
  and the Norman flag elevated in its place. Still
  the Saxons would not fly; the &ldquo;Golden Dragon&rdquo;
  was taken, and they were reduced to a mere mob
  of struggling warriors. The grey of evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> merged into the dusk of night before the retreat
  commenced. In retreat they were almost as
  dangerous as in battle, and repeatedly turned
  and drew Norman blood. The Normans were
  driven back, William advanced to their succour,
  and while their leader, Eustace of Boulogne, was
  whispering in the Duke&rsquo;s ear, he was struck on
  the back by a heavy Saxon axe, and fell, insensible,
  from his horse, the blood gushing from
  his mouth and nostrils.</p>
<p>The Normans, relaxing the pursuit, rode their
  horses over the slain Saxons, in savage elation,
  before returning solemn thanks to God for the
  victory.</p>
<p>Gurtha, the mother of Harold, came to beg
  the hero&rsquo;s body, to give it burial; but William
  is reported to have refused, ordering the corse
  to be buried on the strand, remarking, with unknightly
  anger&mdash;&ldquo;He guarded the coast while he
  was alive, let him thus continue to guard it after
  death.&rdquo; The dead King was, however, interred
  in Waltham Abbey, which he had founded and
  endowed; or, if Tovi, Canute&rsquo;s standard-bearer,
  was the original founder of the abbey, yet Harold
  was largely its benefactor.</p>
<p>On the field of Senlac King William built the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> famous Battle Abbey, that priests might perpetually
  pray for the souls of the slain, but, as
  Palgrave remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;All this pomp and solemnity
  has passed away like a dream. The &lsquo;perpetual
  prayer&rsquo; has ceased for ever&mdash;the roll of Battle is
  rent&mdash;the shields of the Norman lieges are trodden
  in the dust&mdash;the Abbey is levelled to the
  ground&mdash;and a dark and reedy pool fills the spot
  where the foundations of the quire have been uncovered,
  merely for the gaze of the idle visitor,
  or the instruction of the moping antiquary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yorkshire endured terrible evils at the hands
  of the Conqueror, as he penetrated its wilds with
  his famous bowmen and men-at-arms.</p>
<p>The year 1068 witnessed a Northumbrian
  revolt, which was easily quelled; but a more
  determined effort to cast off the Norman yoke
  was made in the following year. The events are
  thus recorded in the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&rdquo;
  and were graphically realized by the acutely sympathetic
  mind of the Rev. Charles Kingsley in
  his stirring story of &ldquo;Hereward, the last of the
  English.&rdquo; The accuracy of the latter part of the
  title of his novel is, however, generally disputed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A.D. 1068&mdash;This year King William gave
  the earldom of Northumberland to earl Robert,<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a> and the men of that country came against him,
  and slew him and 900 others with him. And then
  Edgar etheling marched with all the Northumbrians
  to York, and the townsmen treated with
  him; on which King William came from the
  south with all his troops, and sacked the town,
  and slew many hundred persons. He also profaned
  St. Peter&rsquo;s minster, and all other places,
  and the etheling went back to Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this came Harold&rsquo;s sons from Ireland,
  about Midsummer, with sixty-four ships, and
  entered the mouth of the Taff, where they incautiously
  landed. Earl Beorn came upon them
  unawares with a large army, and slew all their
  bravest men; the others escaped to their ships,
  and Harold&rsquo;s sons went back again to Ireland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A.D. 1069&mdash;This year died Aldred, Archbishop
  of York, and he lies buried in his cathedral
  church. He died on the festival of Protus
  and Hyacinthus, having held the see with much
  honour ten years, all but fifteen weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after this, three of the sons of Sweyne
  came from Denmark with 240 ships, together
  with earl Osbern and earl Thorkill, into the Humber,
  where they were met by child Edgar and
  earl Waltheof, and Merle-Sweyne, and earl Cospatric<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a> with the men of Northumberland and all the
  landsmen riding and marching joyfully with an
  immense army; and so they went to York,
  demolished the castle, and found there large
  treasures. They also slew many hundred Frenchmen,
  and carried off many prisoners to their ships;
  but, before the shipmen came thither, the Frenchmen
  had burned the city, and plundered and burnt
  St. Peter&rsquo;s minister. When the King heard of
  this, he went northward with all the troops he
  could collect, and laid waste all the shire; whilst
  the fleet lay all the winter in the Humber, where
  the King could not get at them. The King
  was at York on Midwinter&rsquo;s day, remaining on
  land all the winter, and at Easter he came to
  Winchester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on the 19th of September that the
  Danes and Northumbrians entered York, and,
  amid the flame and smoke of burning houses,
  stormed the Norman stronghold, and put the
  garrison to the sword. Egbert, the seventh
  Archbishop of York, had founded a valuable
  library in the city, but it was utterly consumed
  in the flames.</p>
<p>The triumph of King William was not so easily
  achieved as might be supposed from the account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> given in the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle;&rdquo; and had
  he not succeeded in buying off the Danish fleet,
  it is quite possible that all the fruit of his great
  victory at Senlac might have been swallowed up
  at York. Although the Northumbrians were not
  strong enough to brave the Normans in open
  field, they defended York against all the attacks
  of the King&rsquo;s troops for a period of six months,
  and the garrison only surrendered when they
  were in danger of perishing from starvation.</p>
<p>During the siege Waltheof Siwardsson especially
  distinguished himself, and on one occasion
  defended, single-handed, a breach in the city-wall,
  dashing out the brains of the Normans as they
  came within the sweep of his axe.</p>
<p>In the first burst of rage on receiving news
  of the slaughter of the Norman garrison, William
  vowed to lay the whole of Northumbria in ashes,
  and he carried out with ruthless severity this rash
  and cruel resolution. The troops who fought beneath
  his banner were mercenary cut-throats, the
  fit agents of his vengeance, and they addressed
  themselves to the work of destruction with a keen
  appreciation. The peasantry fell by the edge of
  the sword, neither age nor sex being respected:
  the shrieking children were mingled in the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> ruin. Cottages were fired, orchards hewn
  down, the instruments of husbandry destroyed,
  and every energy was bent to the destruction of
  human life, and to ensure by starvation the death
  of those whom the sword failed to reach. For
  nine years after the storm had passed over the
  devoted province, the ground remained untilled,
  and the villages unrestored. The wretched fugitives
  who hid their heads in forests and caves
  were driven to feed upon the flesh of unclean
  cats and dogs, and finally they endeavoured to
  prolong their miserable lives by the last resort
  to cannibalism. It is computed that one hundred
  thousand persons perished in a district of sixty
  miles in length. The sea-ports were subjected
  to the same severities, that, in case of further
  Danish invasions, the ships might be unable to
  obtain supplies.</p>
<p>York itself was not spared by the ruthless Norman.
  The prisoners, who had been delivered
  into William&rsquo;s hands by the extreme pangs of
  famine, were put to the sword, and the city was
  given to the flames.</p>
<p>During his expedition to Northumbria, William
  narrowly escaped receiving the reward of his
  demerits, an example of poetic justice that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> have been particularly striking to the historian,
  and useful to the moralist.</p>
<p>While on the march from Hexham to York, he
  became involved in a wild and unknown country;
  his horses perished, his soldiers were reduced
  to the extremes of suffering and privation; and
  William missed his way, in the obscurity of a
  night-march, and was reduced to a state of great
  anxiety, not to say fear, being uncertain of the
  ground over which he wandered, and equally uncertain
  of the direction in which his troops were
  marching.</p>
<p>The North continued to suffer from war and
  invasion. Malcolm wasted Northumberland, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1079, and his wild Scots invaded the country as
  far as the Tyne, and re-entered Scotland with
  much spoil, and many prisoners.</p>
<p>The bishopric of Durham had been bestowed
  upon Walcher of Lorraine, and as he equally
  governed by crozier and sword, taxing the people
  heavily, and allowing his Norman mercenaries to
  plunder, insult, and slay his flock at their pleasure,
  he was bitterly hated; and, when his servant
  Gilbert murdered Liulf, a noble Englishman,
  who had married Jarl Siward&rsquo;s widow, the mother
  of the heroic Waltheof, their rage knew no bounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> Walcher consented to confer with the Northumbrians
  at Gateshead, and was attended by a large
  escort. Every Englishman carried a weapon
  with him, concealed beneath his garment, and
  the bishop, becoming alarmed for his life, took
  refuge in the church, which was speedily fired,
  when the murderer and his accomplice were driven
  out, and received a summary requital for their
  crime. Compelled to sally out by flame and
  smoke, the bishop appeared among the raging
  multitude, his face wrapped in the skirt of his
  robe. There was silence, then a voice gave the
  death-words: &ldquo;Good rede, short rede! slay ye
  the bishop!&rdquo; and the protector of murderers was
  slain. His escort of a hundred men, Normans
  and Flemings, died beneath Northumbrian steel
  in that awful hour, only two of his servants,
  menials of English birth, being saved.</p>
<p>Vengeance was delegated to Odo of Bayeux,
  and there was no Hereward, no Waltheof to
  welcome him with blood-wet steel. He entered
  Durham unopposed, a Norman army at his back,
  and slew or maimed all the men that he could
  find.</p>
<p>Seven years later, and William lay dying in
  the monastery of St. Gervas, passing to his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> account at sunrise on the 9th of September,
  as the bells of St. Mary tolled the hour
  of prime. His last words were: &ldquo;I recommend
  my soul to my Lady Mary, the holy mother
  of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rufus succeeded, and in his reign the King&rsquo;s
  army besieged Durham Castle, and received its
  surrender. This arose from the revolt of Odo of
  Bayeux, who was captured at Rochester Castle,
  and sent out of the country, to the sound of
  Saxon curses and the triumphant strains of Saxon
  trumpets, for the proud prelate who had cursed
  England with his presence since the day of Senlac
  was conquered by Saxon steel at last.</p>
<p>The North was again ravaged by the Scots, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1091, when Rufus marched to protect it, and
  &ldquo;Edgar Atheling mediated a peace between the
  kings.&rdquo; The following year saw the King again
  in the North, with a large following, when, &ldquo;he
  repaired the city (Carlisle), and built the castle.
  And he drove out Dolfin, who had before governed
  that country, and having placed a garrison
  in that castle he returned into the South, and
  sent a great number of rustic Englishmen thither,
  with their wives and cattle, that they might settle
  there and cultivate the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1093.&mdash;&ldquo;King Malcolm returned home to
  Scotland, and as soon as he came thither, he assembled
  his troops and invaded England, ravaging
  the country with more fury than behoved him: and
  Robert, Earl of Northumberland, with his men,
  lay in wait for him, and slew him unawares.
  He was killed by MorÃ¦l of Bamborough, the
  earl&rsquo;s steward, and King Malcolm&rsquo;s own godfather:
  his son Edward, who, had he lived, would
  have been King after his father, was killed with
  him. When the good Queen Margaret heard
  that her most beloved lord, and her son, were
  thus cut off, she was grieved in spirit unto
  death, and she went with her priest into the
  church, and having gone through all befitting
  rites, she prayed of God that she might give up
  the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Northern province had little rest from
  marching armies, sieges, and battles. In the
  Easter of 1095, Robert, Earl of Northumberland,
  treated with contempt the King&rsquo;s summons to
  attend the court at Winchester; whereon the
  King took an early opportunity of attacking him,
  seized his principal servants and officers, took
  Tynemouth Castle, and after vainly besieging Bamborough,
  built a castle, <i>Malveisin</i>, or &ldquo;evil neighbour,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> over against it, and leaving therein a strong
  garrison departed. After the King&rsquo;s departure,
  the earl sallied out one night, riding towards Tynemouth,
  when a part of the garrison of <i>Malveisin</i> pursued after him, carried him off, wounded, and
  slew or captured his attendants. On this Rufus
  ordered his captains to carry Northumberland to
  Bamborough Castle, and summon it to surrender,
  threatening to put out the earl&rsquo;s eyes if the castle
  continued to hold out. The scheme was successful,
  the countess&mdash;a young and beautiful woman,
  recently married to Northumberland&mdash;at once
  surrendered, when the unhappy earl was condemned
  to a life-long imprisonment.</p>
<p>The mysterious death of William Rufus, who
  was found in the New Forest, slain by an arrow,
  on the 2nd of August, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1100, was followed
  by the accession of Henry I., when the Northern
  provinces of the island enjoyed a period of unwonted
  repose, which was terminated by the
  usurpation of Stephen of Blois, when the Scottish
  invasions re-commenced, and the battle of the
  Standard was fought.</p>
<p>During these years York was steadily rising
  from its ashes, after the Conqueror&rsquo;s fiery chastisement,
  when, on the 4th June, 1137, a fire accidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> broke out, and the city was again consumed.</p>
<p>Of the patriots who combatted so valiantly
  against the Conqueror during the invasion of
  Northumbria, Earl Edwin was slain in 1071,
  being betrayed to the Normans by three of his
  servants; Morkar, after joining Hereward in the
  famous Camp of Refuge, fell into the hands of
  the King, and was cast into prison, pursuant to a
  sentence of imprisonment for life, but, when the
  Conqueror lay on his death-bed, he ordered his
  release, and William Rufus immediately re-committed
  him to prison; Earl Cospatrick was banished
  for the slaughter of the Normans at Durham
  and York, and received honours and lands from
  the King of Scotland. Hereward was murdered
  by the Normans, but exacted an heroic price for
  his life.</p>

<h2><a name="IV_BATTLE_OF_THE_STANDARD" id="IV_BATTLE_OF_THE_STANDARD">IV.&mdash;BATTLE OF THE STANDARD.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1138.</h3>
<p>The crown which the Conqueror won at
  Hastings was fated to pass from the direct
  male line of succession in the third generation.</p>
<p>Robert, the eldest of King William&rsquo;s sons, was
  passed over by his father, who transmitted the
  crown to Rufus. When that violent, but not
  wholly ungenerous, prince was slain in the New
  Forest Prince Henry, the Conqueror&rsquo;s youngest
  son, usurped the crown, and ultimately overcame
  his brother Robert, seized his Duchy of Normandy,
  and condemned him to a life-long imprisonment.</p>
<p>Each of the brothers had a son bearing the
  name of his grandsire, and it appeared certain
  that the feud of the fathers would be perpetuated
  by the children.</p>
<p>William, son of Robert, had many stout friends,
  and enjoyed, in a special degree, the protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> of the King of France; hence wars and revolts
  arose in the King&rsquo;s usurped Duchy of Normandy,
  and it seemed probable that when King Henry
  died the duchy would be re-conquered by Robert&rsquo;s
  son. All the energies of King Henry were
  therefore turned to securing the duchy for his son.
  In the year 1120 he carried the prince to Normandy,
  and, by his valour and address in the
  field, seconded by his crafty policy, he succeeded
  in restoring peace and order in the duchy, and
  also in detaching his nephew&rsquo;s chief supporters
  from his cause.</p>
<p>When about to sail from Barfleur, he was accosted
  by an ancient mariner, who claimed that
  his father had piloted the Conqueror to England
  in 1066, and besought the honour of now carrying
  King Henry across the Channel. The King had
  already made his arrangements, but he entrusted
  Prince William and his suite to the care of Fitz-Stephen.
  It was a serene, moonlight night when
  the <i>Blanche Nef</i> sailed, but the prince had provided
  too generously for the good cheer of the
  mariners, and a drunken and careless crew carried
  him to his fate. The <i>Blanche Nef</i> struck on the
  rocks of the Ras de Catte, and rapidly filled.
  Prince William was hastily thrust into the ship&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> boat, but he insisted upon attempting the rescue
  of his half-sister, and vainly, but generously, sacrificed
  his life in the endeavour.</p>
<p>The position of Duke Robert&rsquo;s son was apparently
  more hopeful now that he was the only
  lineal male heir to the throne. King Henry was
  not, however, the less earnest in his endeavours
  to transmit all his dignities to his own children.
  Thus reads the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&rdquo; for
  1127:&mdash;&ldquo;This year at Christmas, King Henry
  held his court at Windsor, and David, King of
  Scotland, was there, and all the headmen of England,
  both clergy and laity. And the King caused
  the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and all the
  thanes who were present, to swear to place England
  and Normandy, after his death, in the hands
  of his daughter the princess, who had been the wife
  of the Emperor of Saxony. And then he sent her
  to Normandy, accompanied by her brother Robert,
  Earl of Gloucester, and by Brian, the son of
  the Earl Alan Fergan; and he caused her to be
  wedded to the son of the Earl of Anjou, named
  Geoffrey Martel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following year the brief, but brilliant,
  career of Prince William came to an end. After
  a most honourable campaign, whilst &ldquo;he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> besieging
  Eu against King Henry, and expected on the morrow to receive its surrender,
  for the enemy was almost worn-out, the young man died of a
  slight wound in the hand, leaving behind him an
  endless name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert of Normandy fulfilled the number of
  his days in the year 1134. No doubt the statement
  of Matthew Paris was quite correct:&mdash;&ldquo;When
  the King heard of his death, he did not
  grieve much, but commanded the body to be
  reverently interred in the conventual church of
  Gloucester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Henry had reigned many years, and committed
  many crimes to secure his crown, but, such
  is the irony of fate, he was not permitted to enjoy
  his triumph long, for, on the 1st of December,
  he died through over-indulgence in supping on
  lampreys, and, to use the expressive ambiguity
  of Carlyle, &ldquo;went to his own place, wherever
  that might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prominent among the nobles of England was
  Stephen, Count of Blois, the son of the Conqueror&rsquo;s
  daughter Adela, and the first peer of the
  realm&mdash;a position which he put to the proof when
  the oath of allegiance was taken to the ex-Empress
  Matilda, Robert, Duke of Gloucester, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> vainly claimed precedence, although he could only
  claim as the natural son of the King.</p>
<p>Stephen was a brave, generous, and popular
  noble, and both the peers and commons of England
  would have preferred his rule to that of the
  King&rsquo;s daughter; when, therefore, he made claim
  to the throne no opposition was raised. &ldquo;For
  when the nobles of the kingdom were assembled
  at London, he promised that the laws should be
  reformed to the satisfaction of every one of them,
  and William, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was
  the first of all the nobles to take the oath of
  fidelity to the Empress as Queen of England,
  now consecrated Stephen to be King. In fine,
  all the bishops, earls, and barons who had sworn
  fealty to the King&rsquo;s daughter and her heirs gave
  their adhesion to King Stephen, saying that it
  would be a shame for so many nobles to submit
  themselves to a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having obtained the crown, Stephen assisted in
  burying the corpse of his uncle, being one of those
  who sustained the coffin on their shoulders. How
  suggestive such a scene must have appeared to
  many who were present. The dead King had
  broken the closest ties of relationship and blood
  in obtaining the crown; the retribution that took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> the shape of his son&rsquo;s untimely death was to
  some extent compensated by the death of his
  nephew; but no sooner is the old King dead
  than his nephew usurps the crown, maugre his
  vows of allegiance to Matilda, and piously assists
  in conveying him to the grave.</p>
<p>For the moment no man seemed disposed to
  maintain the claims of the ex-Empress: the first
  to move on her behalf being her uncle David,
  King of Scotland, a humane and religious prince,
  who occupied the same relationship to Stephen&rsquo;s
  wife that he did to the ex-Empress.</p>
<p>In his first invasion David succeeded in
  occupying Carlisle and Newcastle, but being
  confronted by Stephen at the head of a powerful
  army, a treaty was entered into at Durham,
  whereby King David engaged to abandon hostilities
  on certain territorial concessions being
  made to him. Thrice in one year Northumbria
  was inundated by the wild Scots, and Stephen,
  harassed by his treacherous barons, could only
  avenge his unhappy subjects by laying waste the
  frontiers of Scotland.</p>
<p>The wildest storm of war swept over Northumbria
  in the year 1138, the unfortunate inhabitants
  of that province being mercilessly slaughtered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> in requital for the sins of their princes and nobles&mdash;sins
  in which they had neither art nor part.
  David was deeply afflicted by the enormous
  cruelties which his troops perpetrated, but he
  was utterly unable to control their passions, and
  endeavoured to quieten his conscience by condemning
  the acts of his armies, and by his royal
  munificence to the church&mdash;James the First
  expressed his appreciation of the liberality of
  his predecessor by remarking that, &ldquo;He kythed
  a sair saint to the crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tumultuary army which followed him    &ldquo;consisted of Normans, Germans, and English,
  of Cumbrian Britons, of Northumbrians, of men
  of Teviotdale and Lothian, of Picts commonly
  called men of Galloway, and of Scots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barely threescore years and ten had elapsed
  since William the Norman had carried fire and
  sword through Northumbria. The charred and
  blackened ruins of grange and village were not
  yet entirely hidden by the dense growth of
  bramble and thorn; and the human bones, that
  had been gnawed by the wolves in their midnight
  banquets in the evil days that succeeded
  the Confessor&rsquo;s death, had not yet mouldered into
  their kindred earth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>It was in the wild and stormy season of the
  opening spring of 1138 that King David commenced
  his operations.</p>
<p>Shaken to its centre, Northumbria lay at the
  mercy of the invader: again the sword reaped
  its bloody harvest, again the torch performed its
  evil office, and the midnight skies were illumined
  by the glare of burning homesteads and villages.
  The highways and byeways were strewn with the
  dead: with the gashed clay of strong men, of
  women, and of little children. Age and womanhood
  lay together in dishonoured death; the white
  hairs and the flowing tresses trodden in the same
  bloody mire, and, most cruel spectacle! the little
  babes, pierced and shattered by spears, lay where
  they had been cast in fiendish sport by the pitiless
  barbarians. The blood of the priests reeked
  upon the altars of the most High God, and the
  sacred fanes were heaped with the sweltering corruption
  of slain worshippers. Miserable fugitives
  turned their faces towards the Humber, striving
  to escape the hot-footed Scot, who pressed so
  keen and fast upon their track.</p>
<p>The remnant of the maddened people, desperate
  in their despair, only required a leader to
  organise and direct their strength.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>Thurstan, the aged Archbishop of York, although
  bowed down to the verge of the grave
  by the weight of many years and infirmities,
  came forward to organise the strength of his
  afflicted people. Stephen being unable to disengage
  himself from the toils of his revolted
  barons, the civil war having already broken out
  in the south, despatched Bernard de Baliol to
  the north, at the head of a body of men-at-arms.
  The real strength of the movement was, however,
  the combination of those eminent northern barons,
  William, Earl of Albemarle, Robert de Ferrars,
  William Percy, Roger de Mowbray, Ilbert de
  Lacy, and the veteran Walter l&rsquo;Espec, who,
  responding with prompt energy to the supplications
  of Archbishop Thurstan, gathered their
  vassals together, and prepared to take the field,
  as soon as all arrangements were completed, and
  the widely scattered strength of the North was
  concentrated.</p>
<p>To draw the people to one standard, and to
  animate them with an unconquerable fortitude,
  was the peculiar work of the Archbishop; but,
  being too infirm to take a public part in the exciting
  scenes which were being enacted, he deputed
  Ralph Nowel, the titular Bishop of Orkney, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> carry out his plans. This prelate caught the
  spirit of his superior, and a signal success rewarded
  his efforts. Processions of the clergy
  were organised, and the exhibition of crosses,
  relics, and religious banners, tended to increase
  the devoted courage of the superstitious peasantry.
  The whole of the male population was called to
  arms, and a certain victory was promised, with
  a quick transition into paradise for those who
  perished on the field. Thirsk was the rendezvous,
  and, as the news was carried through the
  province, men-at-arms and knights came trooping
  in, attended by the desperate peasantry, whose
  rude arms, and lack of defensive armour, but ill
  befitted them for what promised to be so dubious
  and sanguinary an enterprise.</p>
<p>Three days were occupied in fasting and devotion:
  the troops then took a common vow of
  adherence to each other, victory being most
  emphatically promised them. Nerved by every
  art of the church, by their own desperate position,
  and by their thirst for vengeance, they encamped
  around the grand standard which Thurstan had
  raised at Elfer-tun, to command their piety and
  patriotism. It consisted of a lofty spar, or mast,
  mounted on a huge four-wheeled car, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> terminating in a large crucifix, with a silver box
  attached, containing the sacramental elements of
  the Romish Church. Around the mast waved
  the holy banners of the sainted Peter of York,
  Wilfrid of Ripon, and John of Beverley. Hugo
  de Sotevagina, Archdeacon of York, inscribed this
  remarkable rhyme on the foot of the mast:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
  <table summary="poem">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;Dicitur a stando standardum quod stitit illic<br />

        <div class="stanza"> <span class="i1">Standard, from stand, this fight we aptly call:<br />

          </span> </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p class="pn">From the turn of the lines we should infer that the
  inscription was affixed subsequent to the battle.</p>
<p>Norman baron and Saxon peasant had not long
  to wait the trial of strength. The summer was
  now far advanced, for David had been detained
  before the strong fortress of Norham; but that
  stronghold once in his hands, he marched onward,
  unopposed, until he approached the neighbourhood
  of York. His standard was simply a wreath
  of blooming heather, attached to a long lance.
  Eustace Fitz-John commanded the guard of
  completely accoutred knights and men-at-arms
  which attended Prince Henry, the commander
  of the first division, comprising Lowlanders, defended
  by cuirasses, and armed with long pikes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> the archers of Teviotdale and Liddesdale; the
  troopers of Cumberland and Westmoreland, riding
  small but useful horses; and the fierce Galwegians,
  destitute of defensive armour, and bearing
  long and slender pikes. The Highlanders and
  Islemen followed the first division, and carried
  target, claymore, and the ancient Danish war-axe.
  King David followed with a gallant body of
  Anglo-Norman and English knights, and a mixed
  corps of warriors, gathered from various parts of
  the land, brought up the rear.</p>
<p>With King David marched his warlike nephew,
  William MacDonoquhy, flushed with the memory
  of his victory at Clitheroe, where, on the 4th of
  June, he had defeated a strong force of the
  English, and gained much spoil.</p>
<p>The position of the Anglo-Norman barons was
  extremely peculiar; not only did King David
  claim Northumberland, where they held lands,
  but they acknowledged him for their liege lord,
  holding from him estates which were situate on
  the Scottish side of the border. Under these
  circumstances they prudently despatched Robert
  Bruce, Earl of Annandale, and Bernard de Baliol,
  to the Scottish camp, to offer terms to the King.
  If his Scottish Majesty would withdraw his army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> and conclude a permanent peace, they engaged    &ldquo;to procure from Stephen a full grant of the
  earldom of Northumberland in favour of Prince
  Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was, however, firm in his resolution
  to maintain the cause of the ex-Empress; and
  William MacDonoquhy declared that Bruce was
  a false traitor. The two noblemen had no alternative
  but to renounce their allegiance to the
  Scottish crown, and to beat a hasty retreat to
  the English army.</p>
<p>The disposition of the Scottish army was then
  discussed, and David proposed to place his Saxon
  archers and Norman knights in the van, to
  commence the attack. Deep was the indignation
  of Malise, Earl of Strathearn, and bitter his protest
  against the King&rsquo;s confidence in Norman
  mail. Said he, &ldquo;I wear no armour; but there
  is not one among them who will advance beyond
  me this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Norman, Allan de Piercy, angrily protested
  that the &ldquo;rude earl&rdquo; boasted of that which
  he had not the courage to perform; whereon
  David checked the growing quarrel, and pacified
  Malise by ordering the Galwegians to take the
  van.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>It was the 22nd day of August, the wide moor,
  gay with blooming heather, was involved in a
  land-mist, and, as a further cover to their approach,
  the wild Scots fired some villages. The
  English were, however, already formed around the
  standard, expectant of the inevitable conflict, and
  no doubt experienced neither alarm nor disappointment
  when Bruce and Baliol came in on the
  spur, and declared that the enemy was on the
  march.</p>
<p>Old Walter l&rsquo;Espec spake a few soldierly words
  of hopeful exhortation to his warriors, then placed
  his ungloved hand in that of the Earl of Albemarle,
  with the dauntless exclamation, &ldquo;I pledge
  thee my troth to conquer or to die.&rdquo; Kindled to
  enthusiasm by the spirit of the valiant old man,
  the soldiers gripped each other&rsquo;s hands, and the
  vow became general. Archbishop Thurstan&rsquo;s
  representative was not slow to seize so favourable
  a moment for increasing the enthusiastic ardour
  of the troops, and he uttered a brief, but thrilling,
  harangue, in which, according to the old chroniclers,
  he at once flattered and provoked the
  emulous courage of the Anglo-Norman chivalry,
  by referring to the achievements of their ancestors;
  kindled their resentment by pointing them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> desecrated altars of their churches; assured them
  of a swift and retributive vengeance; opened
  paradise to all who should fall sword in hand
  that day, and encouraged them by reminding them
  of their superiority over their enemies in respect
  of their arms and armour. The form of absolution
  was then read, and answered by the solemn
  &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; of the host. All was ready for the ordeal.</p>
<p>The knights and men-at-arms in both armies
  were similarly armed. &ldquo;From the Conquest to
  the close of the twelfth century but little change
  had taken place in the armour and weapons of
  the English; but five distinct varieties of body-armour
  were worn by them about the time of the
  Standard&mdash;a scaly suit of steel, with a <i>chapelle de
  fer</i>, or iron cap; a hauberk of iron rings; a suit
  of mascled or quilted armour; another of rings
  set edgewise; and a fifth of tegulated mail, composed
  of small square plates of steel lapping over
  each other like tiles, with a long flowing tunic of
  cloth below. Gonfarons fluttered from the spear-heads;
  and knights wore nasal helmets and kite-shaped
  shields of iron, but their spears were
  simply pointed goads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to some accounts, the English men-at-arms
  were drawn up in a dense column, surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> their holy standard; and the archers,
  consisting of peasants and yeomen from the woods
  and wolds of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Nottingham,
  were posted in the van. It is certain
  that the Norman barons and the men-at-arms
  dismounted, and sent their horses to the rear,
  and the probability is that the mailed troops
  occupied the front of battle, and protected the
  archers, who were destitute of defensive armour.
  All the accounts of the battle favour this inference,
  although it is distinctly stated that the archers
  were broken, but afterwards rallied&mdash;a statement
  that seems incredible, for the English army being
  outflanked, the broken archers would have been
  cut to pieces, it being impossible for the dense
  column that surrounded the standard to open its
  ranks to receive the fugitives, while the charging
  Scots were pressing hot and hard upon their rear,
  and the action of the spearmen was retarded by
  the presence of the archers upon their front, as
  these unfortunates were being massacred by the
  enemy.</p>
<p>The Galwegians made the first charge, with
  Ulgrick and Dovenald leading. Their dreadful
  cries of <i>Albanigh, Albanigh!</i> (&ldquo;We are the men
  of Albyn!&rdquo;) rolled like thunder over the field, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> they rushed furiously upon the Norman men-at-arms,
  threatening to bear down all that withstood
  them with the forest of their long, thin pikes. The
  centre of the English army was pierced, but the
  formation was too dense to be shattered by a
  charge of pikemen, however furiously made, and
  the long pikes were broken upon shield and hauberk,
  or shivered by blow of sword and axe. The
  Galwegians bit deep, but fell in scores along
  the front, and as they recoiled from the meeting,
  the archers let fly a shower of shafts upon them.
  It was impossible to rally and re-form in the face
  of that storm of deadly shafts, beating as hard
  and fast as winter hail upon their naked bodies,
  and while numbers fell, weltering in their gore,
  the disordered masses began to retire, probably to
  the right and left, while the English taunted them
  with derisive cries of &ldquo;<i>Eyrych, Eyrych!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;You
  are but Irish!&rdquo;) which, Scott remarks, &ldquo;must have
  been true of that part of the Galwegians called
  the wild Scots of Galloway, who are undoubtedly
  Scotch-Irish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the men of Galloway staggered back from
  the storm of arrows, leaving Ulgrick and Dovenald
  dead upon the field, Prince Henry charged
  down upon the English with his knights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> men-at-arms upon the spur. With spear, and
  sword, and axe, he won a bloody pathway sheer
  through the English centre, and put to flight the
  servants who were posted in the rear of the army
  in charge of their masters&rsquo; horses. The oft-quoted
  expression of Alred, that &ldquo;they broke through the
  English ranks as if they had been spiders&rsquo; webs,&rdquo;
  must be regarded as largely figurative, for two
  reasons. In the first place, the Galwegians were
  re-forming with the utmost alacrity, and the other
  lines were bearing down fast and stern, yet the
  English ranks closed in before they could take
  advantage of the confusion caused by the cavalry,
  and presented an impenetrable front to the advancing
  Scots. In the second place, the prince
  achieved nothing by his charge, beyond chasing
  a few grooms from the field. On his return, he
  found the battle over, and passing undiscovered
  through the pursuing forces, succeeded, after many
  perils, in reaching Carlisle on the 28th of August.</p>
<p>There is a curious, but not over-reliable story,
  that in the perilous moment when the English
  were re-forming their ranks, and the remains of
  Prince Henry&rsquo;s men-at-arms were dashing after
  the fugitives in the rear, an English soldier, with
  singular presence of mind, averted the impending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> storm by hewing off a Scotchman&rsquo;s head, and
  bearing it, at point of spear, to the front, loudly
  exclaiming, &ldquo;Behold the head of the King of
  the Scots.&rdquo; Before this ominous spectacle the
  Galwegians fell back in a sudden panic, arresting
  the advance of the second line, and causing the
  third line to beat a hasty retreat without lifting
  weapon on the field. Bare-headed, King David
  rode amid the breaking ranks in a gallant effort
  to rally his soldiers; but all his efforts proving
  fruitless, he assumed the command of his cavalry,
  and protected, as far as possible, the retreat of
  his disorganised army.</p>
<p>There can, however, maugre this oft-told story,
  be no question that a tremendous battle raged
  for upwards of two hours. The devoted savages
  of Galloway rallied, and, supported by the second
  and third lines of their army, closed in upon the
  English, &ldquo;after giving three shouts in the manner
  of their nation.&rdquo; Thus the holy standard, and its
  heroic defenders, was belted with a wide and
  deep hem of raging enemies, who sought, with
  sword and axe, to hew a passage through the
  phalanx of spears that held them back. They
  combated fiercely together in a mist of dust
  and heat; blood flowed like water, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> trampled earth was dreadful with the bodies of
  the slain; but no despoiling hand reached the
  standard; a hedge of glittering steel defended it,
  the Normans fenced it with flashing swords, the
  serried spears sustained the fierce attack, though
  indented here and there by the pressure of horse
  and men. The continuous shower of shafts from
  the archers sorely distressed and harassed the
  Scots, and abandoning all hope of breaking or
  hewing down the valiant enemy, around which
  they had drawn their triple line of warriors, they
  broke and fled. First the decimated remnant
  of the savage heroes of Galloway recoiled, and
  spread confusion through the second line, and
  then the outward hem of mixed troops, who had
  never struck blow, wavered and broke; and the
  battle of the Standard was lost and won.</p>
<p>David valiantly protected the retreat of his
  disordered army, leaving some 12,000 upon the
  field. He halted at Carlisle, in grave distress
  as to the fate of his son, who rejoined him three
  days later, as before mentioned. Quarrels took
  place in his army, and weapons were freely resorted
  to, and some blood shed.</p>
<p>The 200 mailed knights of King David lost
  nearly the whole of their horses, and only nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> carried their harness from the field. The
  Norman barons were not particularly fortunate in
  making prisoners, but fifty knights fell to their
  spear and sword. Of these, William Cumin, the
  Scotch Chancellor, was detained in prison for
  a short time by the Bishop of Durham, and, on
  being liberated, &ldquo;gave thanks to God,&rdquo; desiring
  heartily that he never at any time should again
  meet with the like experience. His companions
  in affliction were ransomed about the time of the
  feast of All-Saints following.</p>
<p>The Scottish army having rallied at Carlisle,
  continued the war, besieged and reduced, by
  famine, Wark Castle; and carried away as prisoners
  a number of English women, who were
  ultimately restored to their friends through the
  good offices of Alberic, Bishop of Ostia, who,
  being seconded by King Stephen&rsquo;s wife, succeeded
  in bringing about a peace, which was
  concluded on the 9th day of April, 1139.</p>
<p>Before the English army disbanded, Eustace
  Fitz-John, who had garrisoned Malton with
  Scotch troops, received their attention. In the
  conflict which ensued the town was stormed and
  given to the flames.</p>
<p>On this eventful day the English archers won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> their first laurels with the long bow and arrows,
  two cubits in length; and this sanguinary conflict
  derives an additional interest from the fact. As
  brave and experienced warriors, the captains would
  probably perceive and acknowledge the service
  performed by the Northumbrian infantry, but
  not one of them considered the possibility of a
  day dawning that would see the laurels of war
  bestowed upon the English archers, while the
  Anglo-Norman chivalry had to be contented
  with less honourable trophies of bravery and
  skill.</p>

<h2><a name="V_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_THE" id="V_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_THE">V.&mdash;AFTER THE BATTLE OF THE
  STANDARD.</a></h2>
<p>The reign of Stephen was cursed by the
  worst evils of civil war. The King was
  captured at Lincoln, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1140, being deserted by
  many of his troops; but was afterwards exchanged
  for Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who
  had been taken prisoner by Stephen&rsquo;s partisans.
  Ultimately Matilda&rsquo;s son, Prince Henry, entered
  England, when it was arranged that he should
  succeed to the throne on the King&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Under Henry&rsquo;s rule happier days dawned upon
  the Kingdom. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1160, a great Council was
  held at York, said to be the first of such assemblages
  to which the title of Parliament was applied.
  The King of Scots attended, with his nobles and
  clergy, and rendered feudal homage for his province
  of Lothian. Scott asserts that &ldquo;homage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> was
  done by the Scottish kings for Lothian, simply because it had been
  a part, or moiety, of Northumberland, ceded by Eadulf-Cudel, a Saxon
  Earl of Northumberland, to Malcolm II., on condition
  of amity and support in war, for which, as
  feudal institutions gained ground, feudal homage
  was the natural substitute and emblem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm, being greatly attached to the King
  of England, yielded to him all his possessions
  in Cumberland and Northumberland, possessions
  which Henry would probably have conquered
  had they not been ceded.</p>
<p>Malcolm was succeeded by his brother William,
  the declared enemy of England. Invading Northumberland,
  he was surprised near Alnwick Castle
  by Bernard de Baliol. Sixty cavaliers escorted
  him, and he made a desperate charge upon the
  English, exclaiming, &ldquo;Now we shall see who
  are good knights.&rdquo; He was unhorsed, and carried
  off to Newcastle on the spur. As the price of
  his liberty he performed feudal homage at York
  for the whole of Scotland, placing hostages and
  certain strongholds in King Henry&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Henry died, broken-hearted and conquered by
  the repeated revolts of his sons. On his accession
  Richard I. annuled the acts of his father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> as regarded the independence of Scotland, but
  homage for Lothian was of course continued.</p>
<p>Early in 1190, a dreadful fire broke out in
  York, and rapidly spread, being fanned by a
  strong wind. During the confusion a number of
  thieves entered the house of a Jewish widow,
  slew her and her children, and plundered the
  house. Benedict, the husband of the murdered
  woman, had fallen in the massacre of Jews
  during King Richard&rsquo;s coronation. Jocenus had
  attended Benedict to London, and had effected
  his escape with much difficulty. Being very
  wealthy he feared the fury of the mob, and
  took refuge in the castle, carrying with him his
  treasures. His example was largely followed by
  the Jews. The governor of the castle sallied out,
  leaving it in the hands of the refugees. On his
  return he was largely accompanied, and the Jews,
  in their fear, refused to admit him. He at once
  raised the country, and besieged the castle. Their
  offer of ransom being rejected, in their despair
  the Jews resolved to kill themselves, after destroying
  their property and setting fire to the
  fortress. Jocenus cut the throats of his wife and
  five children, and this dreadful example was
  largely followed. The less courageous of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> Jews then appealed to the besiegers, told the
  story of the tragedy, and, as proof, threw at
  their feet several mangled corpses. Protection
  was promised to the survivors, when the gates
  were thrown open. The besiegers entered, and
  completed the extermination of the Jews. The
  cathedral was then visited, and the bonds and
  securities of the Jews, deposited there for safe
  keeping, were destroyed.</p>
<p>William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, was deputed
  to punish the offenders. He appointed
  Osbert de Longchamp governor of the county;
  and the sheriff and governor of the castle were
  deprived of their offices, and cast into prison.
  Fines were inflicted on many citizens, and a
  hundred hostages taken.</p>
<p>On Richard&rsquo;s release from his German captivity,
  he sold many offices to raise his ransom. For
  3,000 marks Geoffrey Plantagenet, Archbishop
  of York, purchased the office of Sheriff. This
  rendered him all but an absolute prince of the
  province.</p>
<p>Early in his reign King John visited York,
  and held a convention, which was attended by
  the King of Scotland, and many of his nobles.
  The citizens abstained from any expression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> welcome, and the disgusted King consoled himself
  by exacting a fine of Â£100. In the last
  year of the tyrant&rsquo;s life, York was besieged by
  the northern barons, who were bought off with
  1,000 marks.</p>
<p>Henry III. held a convocation at York in
  1220, when his sister Joanna was engaged to
  King Alexander of Scotland. In the following
  year his majesty attended the espousals, celebrated
  in the cathedral church. On this occasion
  Alexander&rsquo;s sister, Margaret, bestowed her hand
  upon Hubert de Burgh, the justiciary.</p>
<p>Henry celebrated his Christmas festivities in
  York, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1230 and 1252. On the last occasion
  he bestowed the hand of his daughter Margaret
  upon Alexander, King of Scotland. Matthew
  Paris gives a particular and most interesting
  account of the ceremonies:&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Earl-Marshal earnestly demanded that
  the palfrey of the King of Scotland, which he
  claimed as his right, should be given to him,
  with its caparisons&mdash;not for its value, or out of
  any avarice, but according to an ancient custom
  in such cases&mdash;that it might not die away in his
  time through any neglect of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alexander &ldquo;would not submit to such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> exaction,
  because, if he chose, he might obtain these equipments from any Catholic
  prince, or from some of his own nobles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop of York nobly performed his
  part. &ldquo;In making presents of gold, silver, and
  silken dresses, he sowed on a barren shore four
  thousand marks which he never afterwards reaped.
  But it was necessary for him to do these things
  for a time, that his good fame might be preserved
  in its integrity, and that the mouths of
  evil-speakers might be closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Necessarily Edward I. was many times in
  Yorkshire during his Scottish wars. In 1291 he
  treated the citizens to the spectacle of one of his
  state-butcheries, when Rees-ap-Meredith, a descendant
  of the ancient royalty of South Wales,
  was dragged on a hurdle to the gallows, and
  hanged and quartered. In the year 1298, he
  obtained sole possession of the port and lands of
  Wyke, afterwards known as Kingston-upon-Hull.
  Under his royal patronage, the port speedily rose
  to a position of great maritime importance. In
  the same year he twice summoned Parliament to
  assemble at York, commanding the attendance
  of the Scotch nobility, and declared the pains and
  penalties of high treason against all absentees.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>Six years later Edward concluded that the
  conquest of Scotland was achieved, and disbanded
  his army. In 1307, he died upon the
  red war-path, commenced in subtlety and falsehood.
  He drew his last breath at Burgh-on-Sands,
  in Cumberland, on the 7th of July.</p>
<p>In Yorkshire the Barons ran Piers Gaveston
  to earth in the days of Edward II. In 1311
  they curtailed the royal power, and sentenced
  Gaveston to perpetual banishment, attaching the
  death-penalty should he re-enter the Kingdom.
  Edward commanded Gaveston to return, and restored
  his honours and possessions. The Barons
  flew to arms, and marched to York. The King
  fled to Newcastle, proceeded to Scarborough
  Castle, where he left Gaveston in command, and
  vainly endeavoured to raise an army.</p>
<p>Attacked by the Barons, Gaveston surrendered.
  Pembroke and Lord Henry Percy engaged that
  he should be imprisoned in Wallingford Castle,
  and that he should suffer no violence. Nevertheless
  he was carried to Dedington Castle, near
  Banbury, when Pembroke departed, and Warwick
  appeared upon the scene. Threatened with
  attack, the garrison declined to defend their
  prisoner, and surrendered him into the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> of Warwick. Gaveston was mounted upon a
  mule, surrounded by his enemies, and carried to
  Warwick Castle with extravagant parade, being
  welcomed with a loud flourish of trumpets. He
  read his fate in the fierce elation of the Barons,
  but made a vain appeal for mercy. It was rejected,
  and he was condemned to death.</p>

<h2><a name="VI_BATTLE_OF_MYTON_MEADOWS" id="VI_BATTLE_OF_MYTON_MEADOWS">VI.&mdash;BATTLE OF MYTON MEADOWS.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1319.</h3>
<p>After the battle of Bannockburn the whole
  of Scotland regained its ancient freedom,
  saving only the border town and fortress of
  Berwick, the security of which was zealously
  guarded by the unfortunate son of the terrible
  &ldquo;Hammer of Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The severe and even harsh discipline to which
  the burghers were subjected by the commandant
  of the fortress caused much dissatisfaction, and
  one of the inhabitants, a burgess named Spalding,
  proposed, in the bitterness of his heart,
  to betray the place into the hands of the Scottish
  monarch. King Robert eagerly entered into
  negotiations which were placed before him by
  the Earl of March, and deputed the conducting
  of the somewhat hazardous enterprise to his
  favourite captains, Douglas and Randolph. The
  project was duly carried to a successful termination,
  a body of troops scaling the walls under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> cover of a dark night, being materially assisted
  by Spalding, who went the rounds that night.
  Some confusion occurred, the governor of the
  castle made a desperate sally into the town, and
  bloody fighting followed before Douglas, Randolph,
  and Sir William Keith of Galston succeeded
  in forcing the stubborn Southrons back to the
  shelter of their works. Soon after the King
  appeared upon the scene, and, further resistance
  obviously being futile, the castle was surrendered.
  For Spalding it may be said that his action was
  probably more patriotic than treacherous, as he
  was married to a Scottish woman, and was,
  doubtless, himself of the same nationality.</p>
<p>This loss was severely felt by the English, and
  was bitterly resented by King Edward. It was
  followed by a dreadful invasion of the northern
  provinces of England, when Northallerton, Boroughbridge,
  and Skipton-in-Craven were committed
  to the flames, and Ripon only secured
  immunity from a similar visitation by the payment
  of a ransom of one thousand marks. The unhappy
  people were utterly without protection,
  and the Scots leisurely returned to their own
  country, driving their miserable captives before
  them &ldquo;like flocks of sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>Involved with his barons in those wretched
  complications which embittered his reign, Edward
  the II. was so mortified by the loss of Berwick,
  that he hastily came to an arrangement with
  the malcontents, and raising his banner prepared
  to invade Scotland, and attempt the recovery of
  the town and fortress which had so suddenly
  passed out of his possession.</p>
<p>The royal army assembled at Newcastle in the
  month of July, and, being very strong, Edward
  was hopeful of bringing the expedition to a successful
  termination. No measure was omitted for
  the securing of the object in view, and a powerful
  fleet from the Cinque ports followed the army
  with supplies of stores and warlike material.
  The walls of the fortress being so low that the
  warriors at the base could exchange stroke of
  lance with the defenders of the ramparts, Edward
  prepared to carry the place by assault, no
  doubt remembering the feat of his great sire in
  1296, when he rode his good steed Bayard over
  ditch and wall, and commenced the work of
  pitiless slaughter with his own strong right hand.</p>
<p>Bruce, equally determined to retain the place,
  had appointed his gallant son-in-law, Walter, the
  high-steward of Scotland, to the command of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> town and castle. The garrison was reinforced
  by 500 volunteers, all gentlemen, friends and
  relations of the steward. Provisions to serve
  for a year having been laid up, the gallant Scots
  awaited the course of events.</p>
<p>However sanguine Edward of CÃ¦rnarvon may
  have been, he certainly exhibited all reasonable
  prudence before Berwick, and, before commencing
  active operations, caused his camp to be strongly
  fortified. When the hour of attack arrived, the
  valiant Scots who manned the walls of Berwick
  found they had a double danger to meet, as the
  English mariners were bringing up one of their
  largest ships, which was crowded with soldiers,
  who clung to the masts, rigging, and spars, ready
  to leap upon the ramparts, as soon as the sailors
  brought up alongside the walls, and got the
  vessel in position with their grappling irons. As
  the vessel drew near, gleaming with steel, and
  presenting a most formidable appearance, she
  suddenly took the ground, and in a moment all
  was confusion, the mariners straining every nerve
  to get her off into deep water again. All these
  attempts proving in vain, and as the vessel lay
  stranded at ebb-tide, she was set on fire by the
  Scots, and consumed, to the great elation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> garrison, and equally to the disgust of the
  English.</p>
<p>While this exciting incident was being enacted,
  Edward was furiously assaulting the town from
  the land, sending his fierce stormers, who were
  abundantly supplied with scaling ladders, to the
  attack by thousands, and covering their advance
  by the incessant discharge of his archers, whose
  long and deadly shafts swept the ramparts like
  a hail-storm. But the Scots met the storm with
  indomitable bravery, fringing their walls with
  glittering pikes, hurling down showers of missiles
  upon the enemy, casting down their ladders, and
  sending their heavy axes through the iron skull-caps
  of the stormers before they could make good
  their foot-hold upon the ramparts. After long
  hours of stubborn and sanguinary toil, Edward
  withdrew his troops to the shelter of their entrenchments,
  and both parties rested after their
  severe and exhausting toil: but at the base of
  the walls, and upon the bloody ramparts many
  brave men slept their long death-sleep.</p>
<p>Untamed by their repulse, the English soldiers
  prepared to renew their efforts, and set to work
  upon the construction of a huge military machine
  called a &ldquo;Sow&rdquo;: this was framed of solid timber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> and moved upon heavy rollers, the roof sloping and
  affording an efficient protection to the soldiers who
  toiled with pick and spade beneath its cover, intent
  upon undermining the walls of the beleaguered
  hold. The &ldquo;Sow&rdquo; was especially dangerous to
  the Scots in the present case, for the whole length
  of the walls being exposed to repeated assaults,
  they were so completely outnumbered that they
  were unable to spare any considerable number
  of men to guard against its action, and should
  once a breach be effected in the walls it would
  be impossible to arrest the pressure of Edward&rsquo;s
  stormers, who kept the hardy Scots fully
  employed even while their ramparts were
  intact.</p>
<p>When the English engineers levelled the ground,
  and wheeled the heavy machine against the walls,
  and the miners were waiting, pick in hand, to fall
  to work, the contending warriors awaited the result
  with equal anxiety and interest. Berwick was
  indebted for its safety to the labours of a Flemish
  engineer named John Crab, who had prepared a
  huge catapult for the purpose of hurling heavy
  missiles against the terrible &ldquo;Sow,&rdquo; and, as it
  approached the wall, he discharged a huge mass
  of rock against it. The flight of the missile was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> regarded with the utmost interest by both parties,
  but it failed to strike the machine, and a second
  discharge was equally inoperative, and the &ldquo;Sow&rdquo;
  now drew near the walls, amid the exulting shouts
  of the besiegers; but Crab had now obtained a
  better idea of the power of his catapult, and,
  calculating the distance to a nicety, sent a large
  piece of rock upon the mid-roof of the doomed
  &ldquo;Sow.&rdquo; The massive stone went thundering and
  crashing through the solid timber, and, as cries
  of rage and dismay burst from the English troops,
  the miners came rushing wildly from the ruined
  machine, and sought to gain the trenches, while
  the Scots sent their arrows and missiles after
  them, exclaiming, in grim mockery and exultation,
  &ldquo;Behold, the English sow has farrowed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scots were inspired by their success, the
  English aggravated by repeated disappointments
  and repulses, and the conflict necessarily waxed
  fiercer, Crab working his military engines with
  great vigour, hurling showers of missiles upon
  the assailants, and giving the unlucky &ldquo;Sow&rdquo;
  its <i>coup de grace</i> in the form of a quantity of
  blazing and highly inflammable material, which
  quickly set it on fire. Amid the tumult of the
  assault it continued to burn, sending up showers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> of sparks and dense volumes of smoke, until it
  was reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>The English fleet was brought up to second
  the efforts of the stormers, but John Crab had so
  many cranes and springals in position, and hurled
  his huge copper-winged darts, heavy iron chains,
  and grappling hooks, and bundles of ignited tow,
  saturated with pitch, with such unfailing precision
  that the commanders were fairly daunted, and,
  fearing to involve the fleet in utter destruction,
  drew off, and the Scots, thus opportunely relieved,
  directed their undivided attention to the repeated
  assaults of the enemy.</p>
<p>During those hours of murderous strife the
  grand steward was passing from point to point
  with a reserve of 100 men, and wherever he
  found the garrison hardly pressed he succoured
  them with a few men, and animated them by his
  example and exhortations; and where the slaughter
  had been especially heavy he made good
  the loss from his fast diminishing reserves. The
  conflict was at its height, and the steward had
  done all that he could to strengthen the sorely-pressed
  garrison, only one soldier remaining in
  attendance upon him, when the startling news
  was brought that Edward&rsquo;s warriors had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> destroyed the barriers at St. Mary&rsquo;s gate, which
  they were endeavouring to burn down.</p>
<p>Hastily collecting a band of warriors, he pressed
  forward to the threatened point, passing numbers
  of young lads and fearless women busily engaged
  in collecting the missiles thrown over the walls
  by the enemy, and on approaching the scene of
  peril, he commanded the gate to be thrown open,
  and charging through the flame and smoke at the
  head of his brave followers he fell upon the
  assailants, sword in hand, and after a fierce conflict
  drove them off, restored the defences, and
  made fast the door again. The conflict ended
  in the utter repulse of the English forces, nevertheless
  the garrison was sorely thinned and exhausted,
  so that unless it was augmented by
  reinforcements, or some diversion was made in
  its favour, but little prospect of maintaining the
  fortress remained.</p>
<p>It was the policy of Robert Bruce never to
  risk a battle with his powerful enemies, and
  although sorely tried by the dangerous state to
  which Berwick was reduced, he maintained his
  resolution, but attempted a diversion by despatching
  Douglas and Randolph with 15,000 men
  to make a raid upon the northern shires of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> and, if possible, to fall upon York, and
  carry off Queen Isabella, who there awaited the
  issue of the campaign, imagining that she was
  secured from all peril by her distance from the
  theatre of war and by the strong walls of the
  city.</p>
<p>The Scots were not slow in carrying out the
  instructions of King Robert, but crossed the
  Solway, and made a rapid march upon York,
  only to find that their project had been discovered,
  and the Queen&rsquo;s escape secured. It
  appears that a Scottish spy had fallen into the
  hands of the English, and confessed, &ldquo;how our
  enemy, James Douglas, with a chosen band of
  men, would come to these parts in order to carry
  off the Queen, and those whom he should find
  resisting should be killed at the same time.&rdquo; The
  danger of Queen Isabella, whose character was
  then unimpeached, aroused all the loyal energies
  of the Archbishop and Mayor of York, and
  hastily collecting a body of armed men, they
  made a rapid march to secure her majesty&rsquo;s
  safety, and caused her to be conveyed by water
  to Nottingham.</p>
<p>The attempt to draw Edward from the siege
  of Berwick by threatening the safety of his queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> having failed, the Scottish captains proceeded to
  carry out the second part of their programme
  with the utmost energy, and giving loose to their
  wild passion for burning and plundering, they
  wrought terrible mischief upon the northern towns
  and villages, as though determined to extort from
  King Edward the heaviest price for the fortress
  of Berwick, should he decide to maintain the
  siege, in spite of every obstacle, until it fell into
  his hands.</p>
<p>Deeply touched by the distress of the peasantry,
  the Archbishop of York, William de
  Melton, and the Mayor, Nicholas Fleming, attempted
  to organise an army, and check the
  depredations of the Scots, who had carried their
  wild riders to the gates of York, and set the
  suburbs on fire.</p>
<p>Perhaps history can furnish no more rash
  undertaking than this: Randolph and Douglas
  were cool and experienced captains, and ferocious
  soldiers; the troops they commanded were veterans,
  accustomed to victory, and experienced in
  the hardships and toils of the field; men who
  could only be approached by tried and steady
  soldiers, and who were not likely to yield the
  palm to the flower of the English army. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> meet these, the Archbishop had to rely upon
  burghers and peasants, men little accustomed to
  the use of arms, and entirely deficient in military
  training, and for whom no competent leaders
  could be found. No lack of energy was shown
  by the Archbishop and Mayor, and the hasty
  and untried levies responded to their exhortations
  with equal zeal. There was no time to
  prepare the volunteers for the ordeal, no opportunities
  for testing their courage in skirmishes,
  for training them to advance upon such dangerous
  enemies as the Scots, or to retire before them in
  good order if they found them too strongly posted
  to be attacked with any prospect of success.</p>
<p>As though to compensate all physical defects
  by an extraordinary weight of spiritual influence,
  the numbers of the army were augmented by
  many priests, who are supposed to have been
  brought together at York for the celebration of
  the feast of St. Matthew.</p>
<p>Ten thousand men were all that the Archbishop
  could bring into the field, and with these
  he marched after the Scots, who prepared to
  receive his attack at &ldquo;Myton Meadow, near the
  Swale water,&rdquo; supposed to be a large field, at
  that time unenclosed, and situate some three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> miles east of Boroughbridge, just above the
  confluence of the rivers Ure and Swale, and in
  the immediate locality of the obscure village of
  Myton.</p>
<p>Half the army of Douglas and Randolph would
  probably have sufficed to worst the English in
  fair and open field, but the Scots commanders
  had been long accustomed to foil the English
  by ambuscades and surprises, the fatal English
  archers, and their usual superiority in numbers,
  necessitating the utmost caution on the part of
  the Scots when engaging with their formidable
  Southern foes; and on this unfortunate day the
  Scots prepared an ambush, which was certain
  to foil the onset of the English, and to cast them
  into that confusion which ends in panic where
  undisciplined troops are concerned.</p>
<p>On the English approaching the bridge across
  the Swale, the Scots, or more probably an advanced
  division of them, feigned a retreat, drawing
  the Englishmen within the toils of an ambush,
  that was prepared for their destruction. To
  ensure their more complete defeat, they were
  permitted to cross the bridge, and while pushing
  on, no doubt in some uncertainty, they were
  suddenly involved in dense clouds of smoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> which, drifting before the wind, veiled the movements
  of the enemy. The Scots had fired three
  haystacks, and were coming furiously down upon
  their enemies under cover of the smoke, having
  concentrated their forces &ldquo;after the manner of a
  shield.&rdquo; Before the onset was delivered, the
  Scottish army separated into two divisions, and
  uttering their dreadful battle-cry, one division
  threw itself between the English and the bridge,
  cutting off every prospect of retreat, while the
  other charged full upon the Archbishop&rsquo;s troops.</p>
<p>Confused by the drifting smoke, the dreadful
  war-cries of Douglas and Randolph, the English
  troops were so completely taken by surprise that
  they were half-beaten before a blow was struck.
  With no regular troops to maintain the van and
  rear, and give them steadiness by example, and
  without leaders to form them in the best way
  to meet the charging enemy into whose hand
  they were so rashly delivered, the confused mass
  of Englishmen were held at utter disadvantage.
  With steady charge the Scottish spearmen bore
  down upon them, the billmen and swordmen
  rushed upon their ranks like a tempest, and the
  men-at-arms taking them in the rear, a bloody
  massacre ensued. Utterly unable to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> their ranks, hurled upon each other by the furious
  charges of the enemy, smitten, broken, trampled
  under foot, the English, after a vain attempt at
  defence, broke, and sought to secure their safety
  by a headlong flight. Beset on every side,
  followed close by the victors, cut off from the
  bridge, the wretched troops lost all heart, and,
  seized with panic, thought not of attempting to
  make a stand against their enemies, but turned
  all their energies to secure their escape. A
  scene of dreadful carnage followed: the Scots
  were pitiless in their triumph, and cut down the
  fugitives with remorseless activity. The English
  vainly attempted to cross the Swale, and dreadful
  and tragic scenes took place on the bank and
  in the waters of the river. The fugitives who
  hesitated to cast themselves into the water fell
  by the sword of the pursuer, and of those who
  attempted to pass the river about a thousand
  were drowned. The approach of night alone
  saved the army from utter destruction, and the
  total loss was computed at nearly 4,000 men, of
  whom 300 were priests, arrayed in full canonicals,
  but who were put to the sword with merciless
  severity by the Scots, who lost few men themselves,
  and treating the slaughter of the churchmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> as a pleasant joke referred to the battle
  as the Chapter of Mitton. It was fought on the
  13th, September, 1319.</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas Fleming, who was serving as
  Mayor of York for the seventh year, was slain
  on the field. The pursuit was close, but the
  Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Ely,
  although hardly pushed, succeeded in effecting
  their escape. The Archbishop&rsquo;s cross was among
  the missing, however, the cross-bearer having
  secreted it in the hope of preserving it from the
  Scots; but a peasant finding it by chance was
  tempted to conceal it in his hut for some days,
  when the pricking of his conscience becoming too
  severe he penitently restored it to the rightful
  owner.</p>
<p>The loss of the Scots was insignificant, but the
  churchyard of Myton received a huge and ghastly
  burthen of slain Yorkshiremen. The corpse of
  Sir Nicholas Fleming was tenderly cared for, and
  buried in the church of St. Wilfred, York, the
  citizens deeply lamenting the loss of their
  patriotic mayor, for the repose of whose soul
  special provisions were made by the Archbishop.</p>
<p>From the bloody field of Myton the hardy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> Scots pursued their way triumphantly to Castleford,
  where they crossed the river Aire, and
  proceeding through Airedale, Wharfedale, and
  Craven, bore off many captives and much plunder,
  entering Scotland in safety.</p>

<h2><a name="VII_BATTLE_OF_BOROUGHBRIDGE" id="VII_BATTLE_OF_BOROUGHBRIDGE">VII.&mdash;BATTLE OF BOROUGHBRIDGE.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1321.</h3>
<p>On the 1st of July, 1312, a dark and tragic
  deed was enacted on the gentle eminence
  of Blacklow, where the Avon winds through a
  calm and peaceful scene. The sun shone brightly
  on the flashing waters of the river, on the summer
  foliage of wood and grove, and on the polished
  steel mail of armed men, for the English barons,
  Arundel, Lancaster, and Hereford, were actors
  in the tragedy, and their banners waved from
  the ranks of numerous men-at-arms, pikemen,
  and archers, for at length, by mingled violence
  and guile, they had won into their own hands
  the life of the King&rsquo;s favourite, and him they
  now called upon to conclude the drama of life
  with what spirit and courage he could command
  for so trying an occasion. Then stood forward
  the handsome and talented young knight, the
  favourite of his unhappy monarch, hurried by
  rough hands to the fatal block, and the grim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> headsman performed his unholy office, striking
  off the head of Piers Gaveston, sometime Earl
  of Cornwall, and&mdash;with all his faults&mdash;an accomplished
  knight, deserving of a better fate.</p>
<p>Chief of the self-constituted judges who thus
  presumed to rid themselves of a personal enemy,
  was Thomas Earl of Lancaster, the grandson of
  Henry the Third, and the most potent noble in
  the whole realm of England. To this exalted
  person, a prince of many virtues, Gaveston had
  humbled himself, and pleaded, but vainly pleaded,
  for mercy. Lancaster could not forgive the gibes
  of his fallen enemy. The &ldquo;stage-player&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;old hog&rdquo; now held the life of the offender in
  his hands; his proud heart indignantly remembered
  the shame and mortification of that day
  when, in the lists of the tournament, his haughty
  crest was abased to the very dust, as the lance
  of the upstart Gaveston hurled him from his
  saddle. So Lancaster avenged himself for defeat
  and unmerited insult, and the rude barons declared
  that he had done well.</p>
<p>But Edward of CÃ¦rnarvon remembered the
  deed of shame, and waited, as weak and gentle-minded
  men will sometimes wait, until circumstances
  should enable him to demand of Lancaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> a full reckoning for the blood that had been shed.
  In the first bitterness of his wrath he attempted
  to meet the barons in the field, but they were too
  powerful for so unwarlike a monarch as Edward
  to contend with, and being averse to endanger
  the peace of the Kingdom by attacking the King
  in his own person, they submitted to his clemency,
  and were restored to favour. Persuaded to pardon
  the crime Edward would not legalize it by declaring
  Piers Gaveston a traitor, although importuned
  to take this step by the most powerful of
  the barons.</p>
<p>Time passed, and all men forgot the Gascon
  knight Piers Gaveston, or only remembered him
  to blame his follies and exult in the sharp and
  sudden punishment that overtook him.</p>
<p>After the triumphs achieved by Edward the I.
  in his attempts to subjugate Scotland, and destroy
  its national life by ruthlessly slaying her patriots
  with the soldier&rsquo;s sword or the headsman&rsquo;s axe,
  it was with extreme bitterness that the English
  endured the humiliation of defeated armies and
  invaded provinces. They had taken to the sword,
  and when that sword fell from the hands of Edward
  at Burgh-on-Sands it was seized by Randolph
  and Douglas, and mercilessly it was used, until in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> the invaded, blood-stained Northern provinces
  of England the fear and hatred of the Scots
  became a passion, and he was indeed a bold or
  foolish man who presumed to enter into negotiations
  with the national enemy.</p>
<p>Naturally King Edward&rsquo;s hold upon the loyalty
  of his subjects was weakened by the Northern
  troubles, for the stubborn English mind regarded
  the red-handed crimes of the father as the virtuous
  enterprise of a great monarch, and contrasted
  with his success the feeble efforts of his son: it
  was the glory of Berwick and Falkirk contrasted
  with the disasters of Bannockburn and Berwick:
  it was the ravaged, outraged Scotland of the first
  Edward contrasted with the wasted and blood-stained
  Northumbria of the second Edward.</p>
<p>So troubles thickened around the life-path of
  Edward of CÃ¦rnarvon. His authority was subverted,
  and so low had he descended in the
  estimation of his feudatories, that Queen Isabella
  was denied admission into the King&rsquo;s Castle of
  Leeds, in Kent, then held by the Lord of Badlesmere,
  under his majesty&rsquo;s authority, and for his
  majesty&rsquo;s use. The Queen&rsquo;s attendants naturally
  insisted upon being admitted, and endeavoured to
  force their way into the castle, when the garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> proceeded to extremities, and several of her majesty&rsquo;s
  suite were slain. This high-handed proceeding
  of Badlesmere caused a revulsion of
  feeling in favour of the King, and availing
  himself of the transient emotion, he gathered
  together a powerful army. For once his actions
  were energetic, and his blows fell heavily. He
  took Badlesmere prisoner, and loaded him with
  chains, at the same time inflicting a heavy and
  well-merited punishment upon his lawless vassals.
  He made an unexpected visit to the Lords of
  the Marches, and captured and hanged twelve
  knights. Like all weak-minded men he knew
  no moderation in the hour of success, and presumed
  more upon a transient advantage than
  a great monarch would have done if successful
  in the utter destruction of a hostile party.</p>
<p>This sudden change in the royal fortunes
  alarmed the barons, and many made submission;
  but Edward cast them into prison, and seized
  their castles. Great Lancaster was now sorely
  discomposed, and learned, too late, to fear the
  monarch whose authority he had so openly
  slighted. It had been long suspected that this
  potent noble had entered into a confederacy with
  the Scots, to avert the doom which would probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> overtake him if deserted by the English
  barons, or defeated by the royal forces. The
  time had now arrived when it was necessary to
  call in the national enemy to his rescue; and in
  this crisis of his fortunes he openly avowed his
  unpatriotic measures, took up arms, and urgently
  appealed to the King of Scotland for assistance.
  Before those redoubtable warriors, Moray and
  Douglas, assembled their men-at-arms and pikemen,
  the promptitude of Edward had prevailed.</p>
<p>Finding that he could not maintain himself
  against King Edward until succoured by the
  Scottish reinforcements, Lancaster marched northward,
  and was joined by the Earl of Hereford.
  This accession of strength did not, however,
  enable him to assume the offensive, although it
  encouraged him to make a stand at Burton-upon-Trent,
  where he took up a position that commanded
  the bridge, in the vain hope of holding
  the royal forces at bay, and of receiving reinforcements
  from the disaffected barons.</p>
<p>The noble blood that had already been shed
  in requital of treason against the crown had
  operated forcibly upon the reasoning faculties of
  Edward&rsquo;s violent and restless barons, and they
  prudently kept their steeds in stall, and swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> in scabbard, leaving Lancaster and Hereford,
  with their band of adherents, to make the best
  of their quarrel with the King, alone, and unaided,
  unless they could succeed in reaching the Scottish
  border and forming a junction with the Scots
  under Randolph and Douglas. It would have
  fared ill with the nation if Lancaster&rsquo;s design
  had succeeded, for although Robert Bruce was
  too wise a monarch to attempt to annex any of
  the English territory, being satisfied to strictly
  maintain the integrity of the Kingdom of Scotland,
  yet Lancaster might have involved the
  nation in the distractions of a wide-extending
  civil war, for placed in so desperate a position
  he would necessarily have urged the Scots to
  press any advantage that their arms might have
  achieved, and although the resistance of the
  English would have been the rising of the nation
  against a foreign invader, yet Lancaster might
  have succeeded in winning over some of the
  barons, especially as Edward knew not the art
  of attaching them to his interests, but was possessed
  of an unhappy facility in disgusting them
  by his too-obvious lack of the qualities necessary
  to a great prince in the middle ages.</p>
<p>Lancaster failed in his proposed operations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> was obliged to beat a hasty retreat to secure
  himself from the advancing royalists. On the
  16th March he approached Boroughbridge, to
  find it defended by the Warden of the Western
  Marches, Sir Andrew Harcla, and the Sheriff
  of Yorkshire, Sir Simon Ward. The crisis had
  come: but the conflict was not to win a sceptre,
  or a protectorship, but to escape from the axe
  and block wherewith traitors were requited for
  their misdeeds in the days of the Plantagenets.</p>
<p>In happier and more fortunate times Earl
  Lancaster had bestowed the accolade of knighthood
  upon Andrew Harcla, and he now endeavoured
  to induce the loyal knight to make
  common cause with him against King Edward.
  Harcla was too prudent a man to take so rash
  and ruinous a step, and Lancaster drew up his
  soldiers to attempt to force the old wooden bridge,
  which spanned the river Ure.</p>
<p>The hasty levies which Harcla and Ward had
  called to arms consisted largely of northern
  archers, famous for their skill with the bow,
  and they were strongly posted at the head of
  the bridge. To ford the river was impossible,
  it being sixty yards wide at that part; to follow
  the course of the river and seek to cross at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> other point, with Ward and Harcla marching <i>en
  rapport</i> on the opposite side of the river, and with
  the royal troops nigh at hand, closing in upon
  their rear, was to risk an almost inevitable and
  irremediable disaster. Lancaster&rsquo;s one path to
  freedom was by the storming of the bridge, and
  they accordingly prepared for their last passage-at-arms.</p>
<p>The archers were ordered forward to clear the
  bridge, and a deadly trial of skill commenced;
  the long, keenly-barbed shafts sweeping like a
  hail of death from end to end of the bridge: in
  a moment the dead lay thick at either end, and
  the brave and determined archers of either army
  mutually faced with admirable courage the fierce
  sleet of death that smote them down in bloody
  heaps. It could not last: the superiority of the
  northern archers was beyond dispute, and Lancaster
  ordered back the remains of his archers
  to a less exposed position, to make room for
  bills and pikes, and the lances of the dismounted
  men-at-arms, for the bridge was too old and
  full of holes to admit of a charge of horse. A
  violent conflict ensued, blood was spilled freely,
  and the bridge was heaped with the slain, for
  the old Northumbrian war-fury rose to the fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> music of clashing steel and resonant war-cries,
  and the defensive position of the royal troops, so
  deeply massed at the head of the bridge, gave
  them every advantage over their assailants, who
  could only bring a few lances to the front in the
  hopeless struggle to beat a bloody pathway for
  their escape. The insurgents fought desperately,
  as men entrapped, fighting for bare life, or exacting
  the heaviest price from the slayer. Hereford
  set a noble example to the unfortunate
  soldiers, charging on foot, sword in hand, the
  foremost man in the sanguinary toil; but an untoward
  stroke mocked his valour, and discouraged
  the devoted vassals who fought beneath his flag.
  Under the rickety old bridge, with its gaping
  timbers, lurked a felon Welshman, armed with
  a long spear, waiting for some noble victim,
  whom he could thus slay without risking his own
  person. The wished-for opportunity at length
  occurred, as Hereford headed the desperate
  charge of the Lancastrians, and sustained the
  fight in the vicinity of his concealed enemy.
  Suddenly, to the dismay and horror of his friends,
  he reeled and fell heavily upon the bridge; the
  pallor of death overspread his features, and the
  blood gushed from his wounds. The Welshman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> had gashed his bowels by a murderous stroke
  of his lance.</p>
<p>Lancaster now attempted to ford the river with
  a portion of his troops, but this proved impossible
  in face of the deadly superiority of the opposing
  archers. Sir Roger Clifford was wounded in the
  head; Sir William Sulley and Sir Roger Bernefield
  were slain outright; the Earl&rsquo;s army was
  utterly demoralised, his loss was severe, and
  abandoning the last hope of forcing the river, he
  utterly lost heart, and retired into the town,
  taking refuge in a chapel.</p>
<p>De Harcla now ordered the royal troops to
  advance, and they rushed furiously over the
  bridge, bearing down the last feeble defence of
  the disheartened Lancastrians, and pursuing the
  scattered fugitives with a cruel ardour. Many
  archers and pikemen fell by sword and bill in
  that dark hour, vassals whose only crime was
  obedience to the lords whose badge they wore.
  Many knights and barons surrendered their
  swords, and were rudely haled away in bonds,
  to await the punishment that follows unsuccessful
  treason. That day the shadow of death gloomed
  over many a brave young soldier, whose valour
  might have been worthily employed in defending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> the northern borders against the incursions of the
  Scots.</p>
<p>Earl Lancaster was speedily surprised in the
  chapel where he had hidden his unhappy head.
  Exulting in having achieved so notable a capture,
  the rough soldiers laid rude hands upon him,
  whereon he sadly gazed upon the crucifix, and
  fervently and pathetically ejaculated, &ldquo;Good Lord,
  I render myself unto Thee, and put me unto Thy
  mercy!&rdquo; And great was his need of the Divine,
  for of human mercy he was to receive none.
  His knightly armour was torn off, never to be
  resumed, and, after many insults, he was conveyed
  to York, to be hailed with derisive cries
  of &ldquo;King Arthur!&rdquo; by the rude populace, as
  they cast the street mud at him. In his famous
  Castle of Pontefract was a new dungeon, built by
  his directions, and to which entrance was obtained
  by means of a trap-door in the turret of the
  tower. To Pontefract the Earl was carried, and
  lowered into this gloomy dungeon, so close a
  type of the grave to which he was hourly drawing
  near.</p>
<p>King Edward was not long in reaching Pontefract
  with his army; when Lancaster was brought
  to trial before his majesty and the loyal barons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> who marched with him. Among them were the
  Spencers, around whom he had hoped to draw
  the toils, and whom he regarded with indignation
  and disgust, as the rapacious, upstart favourites
  of a weak and foolish prince. The Spencers
  looked upon him as their most dangerous enemy,
  and Edward was only fierce when defending his
  favourites: who should speak of mercy in such
  an hour as that? Certainly none of Edward&rsquo;s
  barons, however deeply they might deplore the
  fate of the noble Earl, for their plea for mercy
  might be regarded as a proof of disloyalty, and
  Edward was showing a leven of that savage
  spirit which existed so strongly in his father,
  and was shown by the butchering of so many
  noble Scotchmen on the scaffold.</p>
<p>The condemnation and sentence were speedily
  arrived at. Lancaster was to be hanged, drawn,
  and quartered, but being of the royal blood he
  was spared the torture which meaner traitors
  were subjected to, and the punishment was commuted
  to decollation.</p>
<p>On the 22nd of March the headsman waited
  for Lancaster, who was led to the scaffold,
  mounted on a miserable hack, insulted and reviled
  by the spectators, many of whom pelted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> him with mud. Calm and dignified, he implored
  the grace of heaven to enable him patiently to
  endure the sorrow of that bitter hour. The block
  was placed upon a hill near his castle, and he
  knelt with his face to the east, expecting the
  stroke of the executioner; but his pitiless enemies
  ordered him to turn to the north, from whence
  he had expected the Scottish succours, and in
  this position he received his death-blow.</p>
<p>The rebellion of Lancaster involved many
  noblemen in his ruin. Ninety-five knights and
  barons were cast into prison, and stood their
  trial for high treason. Other bloody executions
  followed with merciless barbarity. The lords
  Warren-de-Lisle, William de Fouchet, Thomas
  Mandute, Fitz-William, Henry de Bradburne, and
  William Cheney, suffered at Pontefract; and Clifford,
  Mowbray, and Deynville were decapitated
  at York. Thus bloodily did King Edward avenge
  the death of Gaveston&mdash;for there can be little
  doubt that the blow aimed at the Spencers, and
  the recollection of Gaveston&rsquo;s doom, were the
  motives that moved him to such a cruel exercise
  of his power over his revolted and defeated subjects.
  Perhaps a more humane and generous
  policy might have averted the evil days, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> was left as helpless in the hands of his enemies
  as was Lancaster on the day of his defeat and
  capture. In reguerdon of his great service to
  the crown, Sir Andrew Harcla was exalted to
  the rank of Earl of Carlisle.</p>
<p>Among the revolted barons who fought with
  Lancaster and Hereford at Boroughbridge, was
  John de Mowbray, lord of the vale of Mowbray,
  of Kirby Malzeard, and Thirsk and Upsall Castles.
  Tradition still retains his name, and gives
  a strangely wild and legendary account of his
  death; probable enough, but not to be received
  as authentic history. In the breaking up of the
  Lancastrian troops, in the last stormy passage
  of the day, John de Mowbray, disengaging himself
  from the press, put spurs to his horse, and rode
  off, in the direction of Upsall Castle, near Thirsk,
  where he hoped to secure his safety. The royalists,
  however, were soon on his track, pressed
  him hard, and reached him as he was making
  his way through a lane, within sight of Upsall
  Castle. In a moment he was seized and unhelmed,
  and his throat stretched across the trunk
  of a fallen tree as one of the King&rsquo;s men struck
  off his head. His armour was then stripped off
  and suspended from the branches of an oak tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> his body being cast into a way-side ditch. The
  tradition is preserved in the name of the lane
  which is still called Chop Head Loaning. The
  Rev. Thomas Parkinson, <span class="smcap">F.R.H.S.</span>, gives this
  tradition at length in his interesting volume,
  &ldquo;Yorkshire Legends and Traditions,&rdquo; and quotes
  Mrs. Susan K. Phillips&rsquo; poetical version of the
  legend&mdash;a poem which would have delighted Sir
  Walter Scott.</p>
<p>The blood-stained old wooden bridge across
  the Ure has long ceased to bear the traffic of
  the locality, and a handsome stone erection now
  replaces it. Harcla and Ward&rsquo;s old fighting
  ground, that bristled with sword and spear and
  deadly bill on the 16th of March, 1321, is now
  more prosaic soil, burdened with houses, timber,
  and coal-yards; and is partly cleft by a short
  canal, the property of the River Ure Navigation.
  When the river was embanked in 1792, the excavators
  at the Old Banks, below the bridge,
  discovered some presumed relics of the battle,
  consisting of many fragments of arms and armour.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1322.</h3>
<p>After the tragedy of Earl Lancaster&rsquo;s
  revolt had been concluded by the wholesale
  executions of the barons and knights implicated
  in that misguided movement, the Scots,
  commanded by Randolph, Earl of Moray, invaded
  the Western marches, and ravaged the country in
  their customary barbarous style, slaying all who
  attempted resistance, and driving before them all
  the flocks and herds that their swift and well-organised
  cavalry could collect. What they could
  not carry away they burnt, returning to Scotland
  without having received a check in the field.
  Where they had passed, the summer sun gleamed
  brightly on ruined cots and devastated fields, and
  the English peasantry, inured to toil and suffering,
  gazed despairingly upon the ruin of the fruit of
  the soil, fostered by their hard labour, and by
  the sun and rain of the departed months.</p>
<p>While the Scots were acting Edward of CÃ¦rnarvon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> was preparing to take the field. Referring
  to the English monarch&rsquo;s victory at Boroughbridge,
  Sir Walter Scott makes the following
  reflections:&mdash;&ldquo;This gleam of success on his arms,
  which had been sorely tarnished, seems to have
  filled Edward, who was of a sanguine and buoyant
  temperament, with dreams of conquest over all
  his enemies. As a king never stands more
  securely than on the ruins of a discovered and
  suppressed conspiracy, he wrote to the pope to
  give himself no further solicitude to procure a
  truce or peace with the Scots, since he had
  determined to bring them to reason by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward spared no pains to ensure the success
  of the expedition into Scotland, and Parliament
  authorised military levies in the country to the
  extent of one man from every English hamlet
  and village, and a proportionate number from
  the towns and cities. Subsidies of money were
  largely granted, and enabled Edward to obtain
  supplies of arms and provisions from over seas,
  besides reinforcing his army with soldiers from
  Aquitaine.</p>
<p>The Scottish monarch timed his movements,
  and organised his plans to check the English
  advance, with his customary foresight and energy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> and although the cruel slaughter of so many of
  his nearest relatives and dearest friends might
  well have steeled his heart against the English,
  we are bound to admit that his repeated devastations
  of the Northumbrian provinces were of
  incalculable service in protecting Scotland from
  hostile attacks, although they might and did
  excite the English to cross the border in expeditions
  organised for the purpose of revenge.</p>
<p>Bruce never wanted for an army to invade
  England&mdash;an army that repaid its toils by the
  plunder of the enemy, and this is clearly illustrated
  by the campaign that ended with the battle
  of Byland Abbey; while Edward was spending
  months in raising an army, taxing the people, and
  making forced levies, drawing supplies of men
  and munitions from his continental provinces,
  Bruce had but to raise his standard, when a
  numerous army followed him, to win the reguerdon
  of their toil with sword and spear from
  the fertile English provinces.</p>
<p>King Robert dared not risk the liberties of
  Scotland by meeting the powerful hosts of England,
  with their deadly archers, in the open field,
  and his plan of defence was therefore to devastate
  the English borders with fire and sword, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> farthest practicable limit, and to drive all the
  flocks and herds on the Scottish border far inland,
  wasting the country as far as the Firth of Forth.</p>
<p>As soon as Moray had performed his raid on
  the West marches, he was instructed to join his
  forces with those of Douglas, and cross the borders
  in a more easterly direction, while King
  Robert penetrated into Lancashire through the
  Western marches. The expedition commenced
  on the 1st of July, and was concluded on the
  24th, when the Scotch army re-entered Scotland
  in triumph, with numerous waggons heavily laden
  with the plunder of the English. The vale of
  Furness had been the scene of their triumphant
  march, and they left it utterly desolated; barns,
  stacks and ricks, and fields of ripening grain had
  been given to the flames, or trampled under foot.</p>
<p>The unhappy peasantry, abandoning their rude
  cots, sought such refuge as the woods and wilds
  afforded, or haply took shelter in the nearest
  walled town. Men-at-arms and burghers took
  spear and bow in hand, made fast their gates,
  and kept careful watch lest the enemy should
  burst upon them with fire and sword some
  dreadful night. The wasted country gleamed
  with the light of burning villages, and many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> rude border-fortress was taken by assault before
  King Edward headed his warriors and marched
  northward with his mail-clad barons and stout
  yeomen.</p>
<p>The wary Scots waited not for the approach
  of the splendid army that marched behind the
  banners of the unfortunate Edward of CÃ¦rnarvon;
  although the English warriors were
  animated by an intense desire to avenge their
  wrongs, and not a monarch in Christendom but
  might have quailed at the prospect of joining
  battle with them, yet all their high courage and
  warlike accomplishments failed to serve them in
  their contest with the Bruce.</p>
<p>Pressing onward, rank after rank, squadron after
  squadron, with the glitter of thousands of lances,
  pikes, and bills, and with hundreds of banners
  floating on the breeze, the warriors of King
  Edward found neither foes to fight nor plunder
  to repay their toil, but &ldquo;a land of desolation,
  which famine seemed to guard.&rdquo; The transport
  of stores for so large an army was attended with
  extreme toil and difficulty, for the wasted soil
  would not even afford forage for the English
  horses. The English captains, hoping that by
  some chance the enemy might be brought to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> engagement, resolutely maintained their advance,
  and the patient soldiers held on their way, in
  spite of increasing difficulties and dangers. It
  was the month of August, and the fatigue of the
  heavily armed troops must have been excessive.
  At length the toil-worn army reached the capital,
  but without any amelioration of their condition, or
  the prospect of an engagement. The sole spoil
  between England and Edinburgh was one lame
  bull. Well might Earl Warenne declare, &ldquo;By
  my faith, I never saw dearer beef.&rdquo; A fleet with
  supplies was expected in the firth, but it was
  detained by adverse winds, and after vainly
  waiting for three days, during which the troops
  began to experience the pangs of hunger, Edward
  reluctantly commanded the retreat to commence.
  They knew that Bruce had massed his army
  at Culross, and was keeping them under observation,
  but it was impossible to get within sight
  of the Scottish army, or to force an engagement.
  In their retreat the suffering and enraged soldiery
  burst into the convents of Dryburgh and Melrose,
  from which all but a few aged and infirm monks
  had retired: these unfortunates they put to the
  sword, defiled the sanctuaries, and carried off the
  consecrated vessels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>Bruce was now following hard and fast on the
  track of the retreating army, alert to seize every
  advantage, and anxious to secure the safety of
  his kingdom by inflicting a crushing blow upon
  his enemy. The English soldiery were harassed
  by being kept continually on the alert, and by the
  scarcity of provisions, but their greatest disaster
  awaited them on their native soil. Travel-wasted
  and famine-stricken they entered England, and
  were liberally supplied with food from the principal
  magazines in the north. Partaking with the
  impatient avidity of starving men, they sickened
  in great numbers, and in a few days 16,000 were
  carried off by inflammation of the bowels; and of
  the sick who recovered, few were ever again fit
  for service in the field.</p>
<p>To avert further disasters, and renew the
  strength and spirit of the survivors, the King
  formed a camp at Byland Abbey, some fourteen
  miles from York; and there the sorely-tried and
  weary soldiers found a temporary rest, and again
  enjoyed sufficient supplies of wholesome food.</p>
<p>The position was extremely strong, and under
  ordinary circumstances might perhaps have been
  considered unassailable when held by English
  archers and men-at-arms. It was a country of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> rocks and woods, where deep ravines cleft the
  rocks, and formed huge cliffs, easy of defence.
  The soldiers were judiciously posted on the elevated
  ground surrounding the abbey, a steep ridge
  very difficult to scale, the pass to which was
  narrow and easily defended by veteran soldiers.
  The exact ground that was held cannot now be
  ascertained; it was certainly an elevated ridge,
  and very probably that now known as the Old
  Stead Bank, at one end of which is a piece
  of land called &ldquo;Scot&rsquo;s corner.&rdquo; If this is the
  scene of the conflict, it took place about a mile
  and a half to the north-west of the abbey. Doubtless
  the royal troops were still demoralised by the
  mortifying results of the campaign, disheartened
  by their losses, and weakened and dejected by
  their sufferings.</p>
<p>King Robert&rsquo;s troops were largely mounted on
  small and active ponies, which enabled them to
  follow fast upon the tracks of the English.
  Crossing the Tweed, he attempted to carry Norham
  Castle, but failed, and directed his march
  towards Byland Abbey, for he had intelligence
  that the English army had there formed their
  camp. By a forced march he appeared in front
  of the English, to their great surprise. No doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> Bruce inferred that the English had lost all heart,
  for Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt were then
  unfought, and the world knew little of what the
  indomitable British spirit could endure, when
  great and esteemed captains animated the warriors
  to the conflict. Edward II. was neither
  great nor fortunate in arms, and was dining in
  the abbey, attended by his principal officers, when
  the Scots appeared and commenced the attack.</p>
<p>It was the 14th day of October, and the Scots
  commenced the conflict by a desperate attempt
  to carry the pass that was the key to the English
  position. Earls Pembroke and Richmond were
  there, however, directing the defence, and, although
  taken by surprise, the English soldiers
  made good their position with great courage.
  The pikemen held the crest of the rock in solid
  formation, ready to charge should the Scots force
  the pass, and bear them down again: the archers
  swept the front of the position with showers of
  arrows, and huge masses of rock were hurled
  upon the advancing enemy. The terrible Scottish
  infantry swept on with their long spears and
  heavy bills and claymores, and a hot encounter
  ensued. The Scots were so roughly handled,
  and the position was so strong, that Bruce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> despaired of winning it by storming the pass. To
  Douglas was appointed the arduous duty of continuing
  the conflict, Randolph, with four squires,
  fighting under his command, as volunteers. The
  English advanced post that defended the ascent
  of the cliff was commanded by Sir Thomas Ughtred
  and Sir Ralph Cobham&mdash;two gallant English
  knights who acquitted themselves nobly. There
  was great bloodshed, and hard fighting for some
  time. Bruce, who fully realised the position,
  headed a chosen band of Highlanders, active and
  daring men, and resolved to attempt to take the
  English in the rear, for closely engaged with the
  furious attacks of Douglas, and probably believing
  the natural defence sufficient for their protection,
  the English had neglected to post their troops in
  such a position as would secure them in case of
  a rear attack being made. Bruce seems to have
  realised the necessity of his attack being too
  sudden and secret to admit of defensive measures
  being taken, and, making a circuit, his Highlanders
  quickly and noiselessly scaled the high
  rocks in flank and rear of the English army.
  What followed may be easily imagined. The
  charge of the Highlanders was resistless, and
  being unexpected, a dreadful scene of slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> and panic ensued. Vainly the English sought
  to close in, and meet the foe that burst upon
  rear and flank: this diversion naturally distracted
  the attention of the troops who supported the attacks
  of Douglas and Randolph, and those hardy
  warriors forcing the pass won the heights, where
  a terrible conflict was going on, the English
  troops breaking away, and taking to flight whenever
  the opportunity offered. Good men were
  there, although the panic-stricken fled, and many
  fell on that corpse-encumbered and blood-stained
  ridge, fighting at close quarters, and dying in
  their tracks. The bravest were cut down, and
  those that could escape the toils took to hurried
  flight. The battle was soon over; not so the
  pursuit. Great was the slaughter that ensued,
  but the actual loss of life is not chronicled.</p>
<p>So unexpected and complete was the victory of
  the Scots, that Edward was utterly incapable of
  making an attempt to rally his troops, or effect
  any orderly retreat. Mounting a swift horse, he
  directed his flight to York with all conceivable
  speed, leaving behind him his plate, money, and
  treasure, and even the privy seal. Walter Stewart
  followed hard after him with 500 horse, and had
  it not been for the swiftness of the royal steed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> in all probability England would have undergone
  the humiliation of having her monarch borne a
  prisoner from her own soil by the invaders. As
  it was, the Scottish warrior could ill brook the
  loss of the intended prize, and he lingered before
  the walls of York with his slender force of men-at-arms
  until the shades of evening began to close
  over the scene; but so dejected and dispirited
  were the royal troops that they tamely submitted
  to the affront, although in sufficient numbers to
  have swept away the stout riders of Stewart.
  The Despensers succeeded in effecting their escape
  from the scene of confusion and bloodshed,
  and the day after the battle accompanied the
  King to Bridlington. With them went the Earl
  of Kent, John de Cromwell, and John de Ross.</p>
<p>Many Englishmen had taken refuge in the
  Abbey of Rivaulx when the struggle became too
  obviously hopeless; and among the knights and
  nobles who there surrendered their swords to
  the Scots were the Earl of Richmond, and Sir
  Henry de Sully. The prisoners were treated
  with the greatest courtesy, being simply regarded
  as chivalrous warriors doing their devoir in the
  field; but the Earl of Richmond had expressed
  himself in most disrespectful terms against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> Bruce, and to show his opinion of such ungentle
  behaviour King Robert ordered the earl to be
  closely confined.</p>
<p>On the 22nd of October the Scottish army
  returned to their own country, laden with spoil,
  including Â£400 exacted for the ransom of
  Beverley: they left behind them a ravaged and
  ruined country.</p>
<p>Andrew de Harcla for some reason or other
  had failed to join King Edward with his levies,
  but, halting near Boroughbridge, had wasted the
  country. This was a suspicious circumstance,
  and was openly commented upon, with the implication
  that he had entered into a league with
  the Scots, and would not act against them. It
  was in the last days of the year that these grave
  charges were brought before the royal notice,
  when the earl&rsquo;s arrest was immediately ordered.</p>
<p>Surrounded by his retainers, and occupying the
  strong fortress of Carlisle, the earl might have
  successfully resisted the King&rsquo;s arms until an
  opportunity of effecting his escape into Scotland
  offered; and Lord Lucy, who put the royal
  orders into execution, resorted to strategy rather
  than force.</p>
<p>Attended by Sir Hugh de Moriceby, Sir Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> de Denton, Sir Hugh de Lowther, four squires,
  and a small party of soldiers, Lord Lucy entered
  Carlisle Castle, with as little ostentation as possible,
  his soldiers dispersing, to re-assemble in small
  parties near the gates. Lord Lucy and his
  knights then sought the presence of de Harcla,
  and demanded his instant surrender, with the
  option of defending himself against their attack.
  The Earl declined to defend himself against the
  four warriors, but as he was being carried off a
  cry of treason was raised, and the keeper of the
  inner ward, making a movement to close the gate,
  was immediately slain by Sir Richard de Denton.
  At the same moment Lord Lucy&rsquo;s soldiers seized
  the gates, and the Earl&rsquo;s doom was virtually
  sealed. He was tried before the chief justiciary,
  Jeffrey de Scroop, and was sentenced to degradation
  and death; being found guilty of having
  entered into a treasonable undertaking with King
  Robert, to whom he guaranteed the crown of
  Scotland in return for services to be rendered in
  England&mdash;no doubt embracing the destruction of
  the royal favourites, the Despensers.</p>
<p>It is difficult to believe that Harcla would enter
  into so dubious an undertaking, so soon after
  the failure of the powerful Earl of Lancaster. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> he had acted as the agent of the Barons, we may
  believe that some particulars of the confederation
  would have been elicited during his trial. The
  statement that he summoned the principal inhabitants
  of Cumberland to meet him at Carlisle,
  informed them that he had entered into a treaty
  with the King of Scotland, and succeeded in
  obtaining their support, is scarcely to be credited.
  The Earl is generally regarded as the scapegoat
  who bore the sins of Byland Battle to the block.
  Degraded from his nobility, despoiled of the insignia
  of his knightly merit, the unfortunate man
  was conducted to the scaffold at Carlisle on the
  2nd of March, 1322, and there executed.</p>
<p>Edward was induced by this final disaster to
  give more serious attention to negotiations for
  peace. Henry de Sully, the French knight,
  used his influence to bring the two monarchs to
  an understanding, and a preliminary truce was
  agreed to at Thorpe, and finally a truce for
  thirteen years was ratified by Robert Bruce, King
  of Scotland, and Edward the II. of England, at
  Berwick, on the 7th of June, 1323; a merciful
  peace after such long and bloody strife, and for
  which the name of Henry de Sully deserves to
  be held in honourable remembrance.</p>

<h2><a name="IX_IN_THE_DAYS_OF_EDWARD_III" id="IX_IN_THE_DAYS_OF_EDWARD_III">IX.&mdash;IN THE DAYS OF EDWARD III.
  AND RICHARD II.</a></h2>
<p>King Edward directed his first essay in
  arms against the Scots, in requital of
  their sanguinary invasions of the North.</p>
<p>The flower of his army was supposed to consist
  of 2,000 men-at-arms under Lord John of Hainault,
  and the distinction thus bestowed upon
  foreign troops aroused the honest wrath of the
  English. King Edward was accompanied by his
  mother, Queen Isabella, and while the court was
  engaged in festivities in the monastery of the
  Friars Minors, at York, on Trinity Sunday, a
  dreadful tumult arose in the suburbs&mdash;the Hainaulters
  and the Lincolnshire archers, being quartered
  near each other, engaged in a dreadful
  conflict. A great part of the army was drawn
  into the quarrel; houses were fired, and lighted
  the scene of murder with a weird and fitful
  light.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>All authority was defied, and exhaustion alone
  arrested the conflict, which was renewed later
  on, when the Hainaulters combined, and beat up
  the quarters of the bowmen of Lincoln and Northampton,
  slaughtering three hundred of them
  before the tumult was quelled.</p>
<p>After this the English foot entered into a
  confederation to cut off the Hainaulters, and the
  young King had great difficulty in restoring
  peace and order in his army.</p>
<p>The campaign was extremely unfortunate.
  Douglas surprised the camp one night, cut down
  the royal tent, raised his war-cry in the midst
  of the startled army, and, after nearly capturing
  the King, effected his escape. The Hainaulters
  received Â£14,000 for their assistance.</p>
<p>The Hainaulters were again at York in the
  following January, on the occasion of the marriage
  festivities of King Edward and Queen Philippa.</p>
<p>The foreigners distinguished themselves by
  firing the suburbs of the city, and by insulting
  the wives, daughters, and female servants of the
  citizens, who challenged them to mortal combat.
  The foreigners lost 527 men, slain by the sword
  or the waters of the Ouse, and slaughtered 242
  Englishmen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>Several Parliaments were held at York in Edward&rsquo;s
  reign, and when David Bruce invaded
  Northumbria in 1346, Queen Philippa raised her
  standard in the city. The Scots kept York
  under observation for some time, and attacked
  the suburbs.</p>
<p>The impending battle was fought near Durham
  on the 17th of October. After a vain attempt
  to cut off the English archers, the Scots closed
  in a hand-to-hand conflict, and fought under a
  deadly hail of arrows. The English steadily won
  ground, and the Scots began to break before
  repeated repulses and attacks. The King fought
  like a lion; his banner disappeared; the Earl
  of March and the Great Steward retired their
  divisions, believing the King was slain. He still
  fought on; eighty loyal gentlemen supporting
  him. He was surrounded, wounded in the leg,
  two spears were entangled in his harness, his
  sword was dashed out of his hand, and he was
  called upon to surrender. Maddened by mortification
  and pain, he struck out with his gauntleted
  fist. John Copeland lost two teeth by the King&rsquo;s
  hand, but was gratified by receiving his surrender.</p>
<p>After Edward&rsquo;s days of warfare and pride came
  to an end, Richard II. reigned in his stead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> Some little ferment occurred in Beverley and
  Scarborough, but Wat Tyler&rsquo;s death prevented
  the movement from spreading.</p>
<p>In 1385 Richard quartered his army at Beverley,
  during an expedition to Scotland. A
  Bohemian knight, Sir Meles, was insulted by
  two of Sir John Holland&rsquo;s squires, and protected
  by two archers, retainers of Lord Ralph Stafford.
  A heated dispute was settled by the death of
  one of the squires, who was shot by an arrow.
  The guilty archer appealed to Lord Ralph Stafford
  for protection, and Lord Ralph at once
  sought Sir John Holland, who was also out in
  quest of Sir Meles, vowing to avenge the death
  of his favourite squire. Knight and lord met
  in a narrow lane, and, it being dark, did not
  recognise each other until the challenge passed,
  when Holland drew his sword, exclaimed, &ldquo;Stafford,
  I was inquiring for you; thy servants have
  murdered my squire, whom I loved so much;&rdquo;
  then he smote the young lord, and laid him
  dead at his feet.</p>
<p>Holland took sanctuary at Beverley, and King
  Richard confiscated his possessions, and declared
  that he should be executed if he ventured out
  of bounds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p>Holland was the King&rsquo;s half-brother by their
  mother Joan, the widow of the Black Prince,
  and she besought pardon for the guilty knight,
  and so bitterly bewailed his peril, that, after three
  days of continuous weeping, she expired. Holland
  was then pardoned. He was afterwards raised to
  the rank of Earl of Huntingdon, and being seized
  by the vassals of the late Duke of Gloucester,
  whom he had held in deadly hatred, he was
  delivered to the headsman&rsquo;s axe.</p>
<p>For six months, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1392, the Courts of
  King&rsquo;s Bench and Chancery were held at York,
  Richard being at feud with the citizens of London.
  He bestowed the title of Lord Mayor
  upon the mayors of York; presented the city
  with the first mayor&rsquo;s mace; and created the
  first Duke of York in the person of Edward
  Plantagenet, the fifth son of Edward III. and
  Queen Philippa.</p>
<p>In Richard&rsquo;s reign the battle of Otterburn
  was fought. Earl Douglas won Sir Henry
  Percy&rsquo;s lance before the barriers of Newcastle,
  and vowed that it should float from the loftiest
  tower of Dalkeith Castle. Percy swore that it
  should not be carried out of Northumberland,
  and Douglas promised to plant it before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> tent, that Percy might have an opportunity of
  regaining it</p>
<p>On the following night Percy, with 6,000 horse
  and 8,000 foot, furiously attacked the Scots, who
  were encamped at Otterburn. Douglas, by a
  skilful movement, took the English in flank,
  and a hot encounter ensued, which was interrupted
  as a dark cloud swept before the moon.
  It passed, and the battle was resumed, as the
  scene was flooded with light. Douglas smote his
  way through the press, wielding his axe in both
  hands. Three spears smote him, and man and
  horse went down. He was found dying, defended
  by his chaplain, William Lundie, who bestrode
  him, curtail-axe in hand. Douglas thanked God
  that few of his ancestors had died in bed or
  chamber. He reminded his friends of the old
  prophecy that a dead Douglas should win a field;
  and commanded them to raise his fallen banner
  and his war-cry, but to tell none that he lay dying
  there. His orders were followed, and the English
  were defeated.</p>
<p>The De la Poles, merchants of Hull, rose to
  power during the reigns of Edward III. and
  Richard II. Edward received princely assistance
  from the brothers during his French wars, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> in 1327 bestowed the office of Chief Butler upon
  Richard. William he created a Knight-Banneret.
  Sir Michael was appointed Admiral of the King&rsquo;s
  fleet in the North, and was raised to the peerage
  as Earl of Suffolk. In 1389 he died at Paris,
  a broken-hearted exile. His son and successor
  followed Henry V. to France, and died, of a
  malignant disease, before the walls of Harfleur.
  Michael, his eldest son, took up his honours, but
  perished on the field of Agincourt, a few weeks
  later. William, the fourth earl, famous as a
  statesman and warrior, was foully slain in the
  roads of Dover, his head being struck off against
  the side of the long-boat of the ship <i>Nicholas</i>.
  His son, created Duke of Suffolk in 1462, married
  Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Duke of York.
  Their eldest son, John, Earl of Lincoln, was declared
  heir to the crown by Richard III. He
  fell at the battle of Stoke, June 16th, 1487. The
  fifth Earl of Suffolk was brought to the block
  in 1513; and the exile, Richard, fought beneath
  the banner of King Francis, and was slain amid

  was taken prisoner, after a desperate defence.</p>

  family.</p>
<p>Edward Baliol&rsquo;s expedition against Scotland,
  fruitful of so much suffering and useless bloodshed,
  sailed from Ravenser in 1332. The crown
  that he won was as suddenly lost as acquired.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1408.</h3>
<p>In 1387 the Barons of England deprived King
  Richard of the reins of government, and
  impeached his friends, the Archbishop of
  York, the Duke of Ireland, the Earl of Suffolk,
  Sir Robert Tresilian, and Sir Nicholas
  Brember. Brember and Tresilian were publicly
  executed, the others secured their safety by
  flight.</p>
<p>Years passed, and Richard recovered his authority,
  when he punished the lords appellant,
  sparing only his cousin Hereford and the Duke
  of Norfolk. Some conversation appears to have
  passed between these nobles, and Hereford accused
  Norfolk of having expressed his suspicion
  that Richard would yet revenge himself upon
  them for their past offence, and especially for the
  affair of &ldquo;Radcot Bridge,&rdquo; when the Duke of
  Ireland&rsquo;s forces were dispersed.</p>
<p>Norfolk denied the charge, and the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> permitted the quarrel to be decided by wager of
  battle. The 29th of April, 1398, was appointed
  for the trial; the place, Coventry. The noblemen
  had put spurs to their horses, when Richard,
  under the advice of his council, stopped the
  combat, and banished the offenders&mdash;as guilty
  of treason. Norfolk&rsquo;s sentence was for life;
  Hereford&rsquo;s for ten years.</p>
<p>The Londoners were incensed at losing their
  favourite, Hereford, and when his father, the aged
  John of Gaunt, died on the Christmas following
  his son&rsquo;s banishment, and Richard seized his
  estates, the general indignation was extreme; for
  the King had granted legal instruments to both
  the exiles, securing to them any inheritance which
  might fall to them.</p>
<p>In face of the gathering storm Richard sailed
  for Ireland. On the 4th July, 1399, three small
  ships entered the Humber, and Hereford, attended
  by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Fitz-Alan,
  son of the late Earl of Arundel, a few
  servitors, and fifteen men-at-arms, landed at Ravenser
  Spurn.</p>
<p>Shut out of Hull, he was met at Doncaster by
  the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland,
  who espoused his cause, affecting to believe his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> assertion that he had returned to claim the estates
  of his father.</p>
<p>King Richard threw himself into Conway Castle,
  and Northumberland induced him to leave his
  refuge, to make terms with Hereford. Drawn
  into an ambush, Richard was delivered into his
  cousin&rsquo;s hands. Northumberland had sworn on
  the sacramental elements to keep faith with the
  King, and Richard thus reproached him, on the
  moment of his seizure, &ldquo;May the God on whom
  you laid your hand reward you and your accomplices
  at the last day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 1st of October, the day following his
  coronation, Henry IV. signed a licence for Matthew
  Danthorpe, a hermit, who had welcomed
  him at Ravenser Spurn, granting him permission
  to erect a hermitage and chapel on that desolate
  place.</p>
<p>Richard was imprisoned, and expired in a
  dungeon of Pontefract Castle, but whether by
  stroke of Sir Piers Exton&rsquo;s axe, or broken down
  by famine, matters not <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>Northumberland was honoured by the dignity of
  Constable of England, and at the coronation bore
  a naked sword on the King&rsquo;s right hand. He was
  further guerdoned by a grant of the Isle of Man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 7th of May, 1402, the Percies defeated
  Earl Douglas at the battle of Homildon, inflicting
  a heavy loss upon the Scots, and capturing
  Douglas; Murdoch, son of the Duke of Albany,
  and other captains to the total sum of eighty.</p>
<p>King Henry forbade the ransoming of the
  prisoners, an interference which aroused the bitter
  wrath of the Percies. As though in mockery of
  their pride, he bestowed upon them the Scottish
  estates of the Douglas, and ordered them to
  abstain from ransoming Sir Edward Mortimer,
  Hotspur&rsquo;s brother-in-law, who had fallen into the
  hands of Owen Glendower, the Welsh patriot.</p>
<p>These impositions of the royal commands resulted
  in the revolt of the Percies. The Scotch
  prisoners were released, and assisted the Percies
  in the field. The captive Mortimer married
  Glendower&rsquo;s daughter, and drew that chieftain
  into the conspiracy. The lineal heir to the throne
  was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March. Him
  Northumberland proposed to raise to the throne,
  virtually partitioning the kingdom between the
  Percies, Mortimers, and Glendower.</p>
<p>The revolt came to the issue of battle at
  Shrewsbury, on the 21st July, 1403, when Percy
  and Douglas penetrated the centre of the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> army, and Hotspur, casting up the ventaille of
  his helmet, was shot in the brain by an arrow,
  and fell in the press. The victorious advance
  was turned into a rout. Of Prince Henry, it is
  written: &ldquo;The prince that daie holpe his father
  like a lustie young gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Northumberland was marching to join his sons,
  but retired into Warkworth Castle on receiving the
  news of their defeat. The King, either from fear
  or policy, condoned his part in the revolt.</p>
<p>When the Archbishop of York, Richard Scrope,
  took up arms in 1405, the Earl was implicated
  in his revolt. Sir John Falconberg had raised
  the banner of revolt in Cleveland, but Prince
  John and the Earl of Westmoreland had defeated
  the rebels. The Archbishop&rsquo;s army was
  so strong, for it had been augmented by Lord
  Bardolph and Thomas, Lord Mowbray, that the
  royal captains resorted to treaty, and induced
  the Archbishop to disband his army. No sooner
  was this done than the leaders of the revolt were
  arrested.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of York, Lord Mowbray, Sir
  John Lamplugh, Sir Robert Plumpton, and several
  other unfortunates, were put upon their trial,
  and condemned to death. On the 8th June the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> Archbishop of York was executed at his palace of
  Bishopthorpe, and his head, with that of Mowbray,
  was piked and exposed on York walls.</p>
<p>The city of York was heavily fined, and the
  King proceeded to Durham, where he executed
  Lords Hastings and Fauconbridge, and Sir John
  Griffith.</p>
<p>Northumberland, &ldquo;with three hundred horse,
  got him to Berwike,&rdquo; but on the King&rsquo;s advance
  passed into Scotland, accompanied by Lord
  Bardolph.</p>
<p>After brief exile, the end came. &ldquo;The earle of
  Northumberland, and the lord Bardolfe, after
  they had been in Wales, in France, and Flanders
  to purchase aid against King Henrie, were returned
  backe into Scotland, and had remained
  there now for the space of a whole yeare: and
  as their evill fortune would, while the King held
  a councill of the nobilitie at London, the saide
  earle of Northumberland and lord Bardolfe, in a
  dismall houre, with a great power of Scots returned
  into England, recovering diverse of the earle&rsquo;s
  castels and seigneories, for the people in great numbers
  resorted unto them. Hereupon encouraged
  with hope of good successe, they entered into Yorkshire,
  and there began to distroie the countrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<p>The Sheriff of Yorkshire, Sir Thomas Rokeby,
  is stated to have lured the old warrior to his
  doom. Sir Nicholas Tempest reinforced him at
  Knaresborough, and the little army crossed the
  Wharfe at Wetherby. They had achieved a succession
  of trifling successes, but now Sir Thomas
  Rokeby interposed his forces, cut off their retreat,
  and compelled them to give battle, on the 28th
  February, 1408, on Bramham Moor, near Hazlewood.</p>
<p>They were brave men who thus stood opposed.
  Northumberland&rsquo;s troops were incited by their
  dangerous position, by the hope of recovering
  their lost possessions, and by their hatred of the
  King. On the other hand, the royalists were
  anxious to gain the honours and rewards which
  princes bestow.</p>
<p>The Sheriff was not slack to close, but advanced
  his standard of St. George, and sounded the
  charge, as Northumberland bore down upon him
  with his lances, doing battle once more beneath
  his banner, that displayed the proud emblazonments
  of the house of Percy.</p>
<p>The onset was fierce and bloody. Lances
  shivered to splinters; men went down in their
  blood, wounded and dying; riderless horses burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> from the press, and wildly galloped over the moor.
  Lances were cast aside, as knights and men-at-arms
  fell-to with sword, and mace, and axe, testing
  mail, smashing shield and casque, and finding and
  bestowing wounds and death despite of guarding
  weapons and tempered plate-mail.</p>
<p>The archers were fiercely at work, pouring their
  long shafts upon the rear ranks; the footmen face
  to face with the wild play of deadly bill and thrust
  of pike. Morions were cleft, corsets pierced, and
  men fell thick and fast. The battle was hotly
  maintained, but for a short time, the insurgents
  being sorely over-matched. Northumberland fell&mdash;never
  to rise again until rough hands stripped
  off his mail, and held him for the butcher&rsquo;s work
  of headsman&rsquo;s axe and knife. There ended Lord
  Bardolph&rsquo;s many troubles, as he fell, a sorely
  wounded and dying man, into the Sheriff&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>The leaders fallen, no further object for contention
  remained to the rebels, and the defeat was
  complete and irretrievable. The tragedy of the
  battlefield had to be concluded by the rush of
  the pursuers, eager to maim and slay; and by the
  useless rally of defeated men, turning fiercely at
  bay, to claim blood for blood and life for life;
  and, alas! by the seizure of flying men, doomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> to rope and axe in reguerdon of their last act
  of vassalage to the devoted house of Northumberland.</p>
<p>The Earl&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;full of silver horie hairs,
  being put upon a stake, was openly carried
  through London, and set upon the bridge of the
  same citie: in like manner was the lord Bardolfe&rsquo;s.
  The bishop of Bangor was taken and pardoned
  by the King, for that when he was apprehended,
  he had no armour on his backe. The King, to
  purge the North parts of all rebellion, and to take
  order for the punishment of those that were accused
  to have succoured and assisted the Earl of
  Northumberland, went to Yorke, where, when
  many were condemned, and diverse put to great
  fines, and the countrie brought to quietnesse, he
  caused the abbot of Hailes to be hanged, who
  had been in armour against him with the foresaid
  earle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after his treacheries, his aspiring ambitions,
  the once puissant Earl of Northumberland was
  brought as low as Richard of Bordeaux when he
  lay upon his bier at St. Paul&rsquo;s, his set and rigid
  face, bared from eyebrows to chin, for the inspection
  of the Londoners, and, in its surrounding
  swathing of grave-clothes, in its dreadful emaciation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> eloquent of the unrecorded tragedy of secret
  murder.</p>
<p>A grant of the manor of Spofforth, a former
  possession of the slain Earl, rewarded the loyalty
  of Sir Thomas Rokeby.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry V., an attempt was again
  made to restore the lineal heir to the throne, an
  augury of the War of the Roses commenced in
  his son&rsquo;s reign. The Earl of Marche, the
  object of the conspiracy, himself betrayed it to
  the King. Henry, whose assassination had been
  planned, took immediate revenge upon the principal
  offenders, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, Lord
  Scroop of Masham, and Sir Thomas Grey. They
  were executed at Southampton, on the 13th of
  August, 1415, at the moment when the royal fleet
  was sailing from the harbour to add the terrors
  of invasion to unhappy France, then suffering
  from internecine strife.</p>
<p>There is an old tradition that on the day of
  Agincourt the shrine of St. John of Beverley
  exuded blood, and when King Henry was in
  Yorkshire he naturally paid his devotions at the
  shrine. He was accompanied by his Queen; and
  it was at this time that he received the sad news
  of the death of his brother Clarence at BeaujÃ©.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> The Duke was dashing over the narrow bridge
  when the charging Scots burst upon him; Sir
  John Carmichael shivered his lance upon the
  Duke&rsquo;s corset, Sir John Swinton smote him in
  the face, and, as he dropped from the saddle,
  the Earl of Buchan, with one blow of a mace, or
  &ldquo;steel hammer,&rdquo; dashed out his brains.</p>

<h2><a name="XI_THE_BATTLE_OF_SANDAL" id="XI_THE_BATTLE_OF_SANDAL">XI.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF SANDAL.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1460.</h3>
<p>Although Henry VI. was beloved by his
  subjects, he was subjected to the vicissitudes
  of the Wars of the Roses. His Queen,
  Margaret of Anjou, was unpopular with the
  people, her favourite minister, William De la Pole,
  was hated of the nobles, and nobles and commons
  were alike exasperated by the loss of the French
  possessions.</p>
<p>Richard, Duke of York, a brave soldier, and
  popular with the people, was the lineal heir to the
  throne, and he was determined to assert his claim.</p>
<p>The first battle was fought at St. Albans, on
  the 23rd May, 1455. The royalists maintained
  the town, being commanded by Lord Clifford, the
  Dukes of Buckingham and Somerset, and the
  Earls of Northumberland and Stafford. York
  fiercely attacked, being supported by Norfolk,
  Salisbury and Warwick. The Northern archers
  poured their shafts into the town, and inflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> great slaughter, and the Earl of Warwick, &ldquo;seizing
  his opportunity, moved to the garden side of the
  town, and attacking it at the weakest side, forced
  the barriers.&rdquo; A desperate conflict ensued, Somerset,
  Northumberland, and Clifford were slain,
  and King Henry, Stafford, Buckingham, and
  Dudley were wounded by arrows. Abbot Wethemstede
  states that he saw, &ldquo;here one lying with his
  brains dashed out, here another without his
  arm; some with arrows sticking in their throats,
  others pierced in their chests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was defeated and captured, and the
  Yorkists divided the government. The Duke was
  created Constable of the Kingdom, Salisbury Lord
  Chancellor, and Warwick governor of Calais.</p>
<p>Each party watched the other, and the pious
  King attempted to reconcile the leaders in 1458,
  when they went in solemn procession to St.
  Paul&rsquo;s, the Duke of York leading the Queen,
  and the opposing barons being paired accordingly.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, and Warwick fled into
  Yorkshire, the two factions being put into opposition
  by a brawl between the servants of Warwick
  and Queen Margaret.</p>
<p>In September, 1459, the Yorkists were again
  in arms, and Salisbury, feigning to fly before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> Lord Audley and the royalists, turned upon them
  as they were crossing a brook on Bloreheath, and
  bore them down with lance and bill. The conflict
  was somewhat desultory, and lasted five hours, the
  victory remaining with the Yorkists. Lord Audley
  was slain, and with him 2,400 men, including
  the good knights Thomas Dutton, John Dunne,
  Hugh Venables, Richard Molineaux, and John
  Leigh.</p>
<p>Henry and York met at Ludlow, when Sir
  Andrew Trollope carried his command over to
  the King, and the Yorkists, panic-stricken by
  this defection, dispersed.</p>
<p>The Duchess of York, and two of her sons, fell
  into Henry&rsquo;s hands, and was sent to her sister,
  Anne, Duchess of Buckingham. At Coventry,
  November 20th, Parliament attainted and confiscated
  the estates of &ldquo;the duke of York, the
  earl of March, the duke of Rutland, the earl of
  Warwick, the earl of Salisbury, the lord Powis,
  the lord Clinton, the countess of Salisbury, sir
  Thomas Neville, sir John Neville, sir Thomas
  Harrington, sir Thomas Parr, sir John Conyers,
  sir John Wenlock, sir William Oldhall, Edward
  Bourchier, sq., and his brother, Thomas Vaughan,
  Thomas Colt, Thomas Clay, John Dinham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> Thomas
  Moring, John Otter, Master Richard Fisher, Hastings, and others.&rdquo; On the submission
  of Lord Powis he received the King&rsquo;s
  grace, but lost his goods.</p>
<p>Warwick, March, and Salisbury fled to Calais,
  and Somerset, the newly-appointed governor,
  proceeded to attempt the reduction of the fortress;
  but, by a clever counter-stroke, Warwick
  captured the fleet, Lord Rivers and his son being
  surprised before they could leave their bed. Rivers &ldquo;was brought to Calais, and before the lords,
  with eight-score torches, and there my lord Salisbury
  rated him, calling him &lsquo;knave&rsquo;s son, that
  he should be so rude to call him and these other
  lords traitors; for they should be found the
  King&rsquo;s true liege-men, when he would be found
  a traitor.&rsquo; And my lord Warwick rated him, and
  said, &lsquo;that his father was but a squire, and
  brought up with King Henry V., and since made
  himself by marriage, and also made a lord; and
  that it was not his part to hold such a language
  to lords, being of the king&rsquo;s blood.&rsquo; And my lord
  March rated him likewise. And Sir Anthony
  was rated for his language of all the three lords
  in likewise.&rdquo; A notable scene, and picturesque:
  making easy the mental transition to a later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> period,
  when these fierce lords called for block and headsmen, and their prisoners
  made short shrift. Indeed the period was very near. Osbert
  Mountford, despatched to reinforce Somerset,
  was captured at Sandwich, carried to Calais, and
  beheaded on the 25th June, 1460.</p>
<p>On the 5th June Salisbury and Warwick landed
  at Sandwich, and reached London with 25,000
  men arrayed under their banners. Margaret
  strove to shut them out of the city, but in vain;
  and Lord Scales discharged the Tower guns
  against them.</p>
<p>On the 19th of July the two armies engaged at
  Northampton. Margaret, with a strong escort,
  watched the conflict with the keenest anxiety.
  The heavy rains rendered the King&rsquo;s artillery
  inoperative, yet, after five hours of sanguinary
  fighting, the battle was decided by the treachery
  of Lord Grey, of Ruthin, who carried his command
  over to the Yorkists.</p>
<p>King Henry was captured, and carried, in
  honourable captivity, to London. Margaret fled
  to Scotland, accompanied by Somerset and the
  young Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>Richard of York entered London, appeared
  before the peers, and advanced to the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> placing his hand upon the canopy. This mute
  claim was received in silence, that was broken by
  the Archbishop of Canterbury, as he enquired
  whether the Duke would not wait upon the King.
  York haughtily replied, &ldquo;I know of none in this
  realm than ought not rather to wait upon me,&rdquo;
  and turning his back upon the peers, retired.</p>
<p>It was admitted by the lords that Richard
  was the lineal heir to the throne, but Parliament
  had elected Henry IV. to the crown, Henry
  V. had succeeded, and his son, the present King,
  had been accepted by the lords and commons,
  and, but for the ambition of York, his title would
  have remained unquestioned. The peers passed
  over the claims of the young Prince of Wales,
  and decided that the King should retain the
  crown, but that, on his death, York and his heirs
  should inherit it.</p>
<p>Margaret was immediately summoned to London,
  and prepared for the journey by raising her
  standard. Before she appeared upon the scene
  the battle of Sandal was fought.</p>
<p>The Yorkists now freely dipped their hands
  in blood. Lords Hungerford and Scales were
  allowed to pass out of the Tower free men, but
  the soldiers and officers had &ldquo;to abide by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> law.&rdquo; Lord Scales was murdered within the
  week by mariners serving Warwick and March.
  He was seen &ldquo;lying naked in the cemetery of the
  church of St. Mary Overy, in Southwark. He
  had lain naked, being stripped of his clothes, for
  several hours on the ground, but afterwards on
  the same day he was honourably interred by the
  earls of March, Warwick, and others.&rdquo; In the
  same month, July, Sir Thomas Blount, of Kent,
  with five others of the household of the Duke of
  Exeter, were accused before &ldquo;the Earl of Warwick
  and the other justiciaries of the King, of
  illegally holding the Tower,&rdquo; and &ldquo;were drawn
  to Tyburn and beheaded, and shortly afterwards
  John Archer, who was in the councils of the
  duke of Exeter, shared the same fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke Richard was declared heir-apparent on
  the 9th of November, with the present title of
  Lord Protector, and an allowance of Â£10,000
  to maintain the dignity. The Yorkshire royalists
  were in arms, and &ldquo;had destroyed the retainers
  and tenants of the Duke of York and Earl of
  Salisbury.&rdquo; Salisbury and York immediately
  marched for the North.</p>
<p>Their vanguard struck Somerset&rsquo;s army at
  Worksop, and was cut off. On the 21st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> December York occupied his Castle of Sandal. His
  army consisted of 6,000 men, too few to cope
  with the enemy lying at Pontefract under Somerset
  and Northumberland. The Duke might
  have maintained the defensive until the Earl of
  March came up from the Welsh borders, but on
  the 30th of December he sallied out to rescue a
  foraging party from the Lancastrians. With so
  numerous an army to feed, and in a position
  so remote from succour, Richard might reasonably
  risk something to protect his foragers.</p>
<p>Vainly Sir David Hall argued against so perilous
  an adventure. The drawbridge was lowered,
  and York&rsquo;s banner was given to the wintry wind.
  It bore for device a Falcon <i>volant</i>, <i>argent</i>, with
  a fetter-lock, <i>or</i>. The bird was depicted in the
  effort of opening the lock, typical of the crown.</p>
<p>Behind the falcon-banner marched 4,000 veterans.
  With the Duke there rode to his last
  battle, Salisbury and the good knights, Thomas
  Neville, David Hall, John Parr, John and Hugh
  Mortimer, Walter Limbrike, John Gedding, Eustace
  Wentworth, Guy Harrington, and other notable
  men-at-arms.</p>
<p>Raising the war-cry of York, and sounding
  trumpets, they charged through the drifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> snow-flakes, and awoke the fury of the battle. The
  Duke was outnumbered and surrounded, but
  fought stubbornly, being nobly seconded by his
  heroic army. Lord Clifford hotly attacked him,
  exerting every effort to cut off his retreat. Duke
  Richard valiantly attempted to cut his way
  through and retire into Sandal, but Clifford as
  sternly drew around him the iron bonds of war,
  prevented all retreat, and held him to the trial.
  The battle was extremely sanguinary, and the
  Lancastrians fought as though they were the
  red-handed arbiters of the whole dispute, and,
  like avenging angels, must wash out the treason
  of York in streams of blood. As Mountford fought
  at Evesham so fought the Lord Protector that
  day&mdash;exacting the heaviest price for his doomed
  life. Weapons whirled before his face, rang on
  his mail, and probed the jointed armour with
  point and edge until the good steel harness was
  dinted and stained with gore. Many warriors
  perished around him, and he, too, fell, sorely
  stricken, and died in his blood, amid the trampling
  of iron-clad feet, and the clash of crossing
  swords, as friends and foes fought hand-to-hand
  above his body. The crisis came. The falcon-banner
  fell, and the pursuing swords maimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> and slew the fugitives, burdening the old year
  with the sorrows of the widow and the orphan.
  In the triumphant van, in the moment of victory,
  Richard Hanson, Mayor of Hull, laid down his
  life for Queen Margaret and her fair son. Salisbury
  won his way through the press, to fall by
  headsman&rsquo;s axe. Rutland broke away from the
  slaughter, reached Wakefield Bridge, to perish
  by the steel of Clifford, happy in his early death
  that saved him from the infamy of bloody years
  that tarnished the fame of his brothers, March,
  Clarence, and Gloucester.</p>
<p>Some chroniclers represent the Queen as commanding
  her army in person, and as luring the
  Duke to meet her in open field. Dissuaded
  from the encounter by his friends, he declared
  that: &ldquo;All men would cry wonder, and report
  dishonour, that a woman had made a dastard of
  me, whom no man could even to this day report
  as a coward! And surely my mind is rather to
  die with honour than to live with shame! Advance
  my banners in the name of God and of
  St. George.&rdquo; This is not the York of history.</p>
<p>Rutland is represented as a boy, aged twelve
  years, a spectator, not a combatant, and accompanied
  by his tutor, Aspall. Clifford overtook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> him, and demanded his name. &ldquo;The young gentleman
  dismayed, had not a word to speak, but
  kneeled on his knees, craving mercy and desiring
  grace, both with holding up his hands and making
  a dolorous countenance&mdash;for his speech was gone
  for fear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Save him,&rdquo; cried Aspall, &ldquo;he is a
  prince&rsquo;s son, and peradventure may do you good
  hereafter.&rdquo; Said Clifford, &ldquo;By God&rsquo;s blood thy
  father slew mine, and so will I thee and all thy
  kin,&rdquo; and so smote him to the heart with his
  dagger, and bade the chaplain, &ldquo;Go, bear him to
  his mother, and tell her what thou hast seen and
  heard.&rdquo; Doubtless Clifford was as red-handed a
  sinner as any of the barons, but probably no
  worse. He is said to have cut off the Duke&rsquo;s
  head, crowned it with paper, and carried it upon
  a pole to the Queen, exclaiming, &ldquo;Madam, your
  war is done: here I bring your King&rsquo;s ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such are some popular errors, perpetuated by
  historians who have followed the romantic versions
  of Grafton and Hall. Margaret did not
  lure York to his fate, for she was in Scotland
  when the battle was fought, and he did
  not sally out to fight a battle, but to rescue his
  foragers. The execution of Yorkist prisoners
  was simply a retaliation for the treason and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> blood-guiltiness of the Yorkists, and was carried
  out without the Queen&rsquo;s knowledge. Clifford
  may have vowed to avenge his father&rsquo;s death
  upon the house of York, and Rutland may have
  fallen to his sword: but the duke was in his
  eighteenth year, and no doubt an approved man-at-arms.
  As recorded, he had been attainted of
  treason a few months prior to his death. We
  may safely conclude that there were no schoolboys
  on Wakefield-Green on the 30th of December,
  1460, and the only tutors there were tutors
  in arms.</p>
<p>William of Wyrcester&rsquo;s account of the battle
  may be considered the most probable, and best
  authenticated:&mdash;&ldquo;The followers of the Duke of
  York, having gone out to forage for provisions
  on the 29th of December, a dreadful battle was
  fought at Wakefield between the Duke of Somerset,
  the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Neville,
  and the adverse party, when the Duke of York,
  Thomas Neville, son of the Earl of Salisbury,
  Thomas Harrington, Thomas Parr, Edward
  Bourchier, James Pykering, and Henry Rathforde,
  with many other knights and squires, and soldiers
  to the amount of two thousand, were slain in the
  field. After the battle, Lord Clifford slew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> young
  Earl of Rutland, the son of the Duke of York, as he was fleeing across
  the bridge at Wakefield; and in the same night the Earl of
  Salisbury was captured by a follower of Sir And.
  Trollope, and on the morrow beheaded by the
  Bastard of Exeter at Pontefract, where at the
  same time the dead bodies of York, Rutland,
  and others of note who fell in the battle, were
  decapitated, and their heads affixed in various
  parts of York, whilst a paper crown was placed
  in derision on the head of the Duke of York.&rdquo; Thus perished Duke Richard in his fiftieth year.</p>
<p>Edward, Earl of March, Richard&rsquo;s eldest son,
  was at Gloucester when the news reached him of
  the disaster before Sandal Castle. He promptly
  advanced his army to intercept the Lancastrians,
  and dispute their advance upon the capital.</p>
<p>Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, harassed
  his rear with a tumultuary army of Welsh and
  Irish troops. Marching to engage an army,
  and alarmed by a powerful enemy in the rear,
  was too critical a position for Edward not to
  appreciate its danger. On the 2nd of February,
  1461, he turned furiously upon the enemy, at
  Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross, Herefordshire, and defeated
  Pembroke with a loss of 3,800 men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>At Hereford Edward halted, and handed over
  to the headsman Owen Tudor, Sir John Throckmorton,
  and eight of the Lancastrian captains&mdash;the
  captives of his sword and lance at Mortimer&rsquo;s
  Cross.</p>
<p>London threw open its gates to the victor on
  the 4th of March, and he was proclaimed King,
  under the title of Edward IV.</p>

<h2><a name="XII_THE_BATTLE_OF_TOWTON" id="XII_THE_BATTLE_OF_TOWTON">XII.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF TOWTON.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1461.</h3>
<p>Margaret of Anjou had the honour of
  defeating the famous Warwick. Thus
  Wyrcester:&mdash;&ldquo;After the battle of Wakefield
  Queen Margaret came out of Scotland to York,
  where it was decided by the Council of the
  Lords to proceed to London and to liberate King
  Henry out of the hands of his enemies by force
  of arms. Shortly after the Feast of the Purification,
  the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Dukes
  of Exeter and Somerset, the Earls of Northumberland,
  Devonshire, and Shrewsbury, the
  Lords Roos, Grey of Codnor, Fitzhugh, Graystock,
  Welles and Willoughby, and many others,
  amounting in all to 24,000 men, advanced upon
  St. Albans, and at Dunstable destroyed Sir
  Edward Poyning, and 200 foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s tumultuary army consisted of English,
  Irish, Welsh, and Scotch troops, and their excesses
  tended to the ruin of the Lancastrian cause.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 17th of February the second battle of
  St. Albans was fought. At first the Lancastrians
  fell back before Warwick&rsquo;s archers, but, renewing
  the attack, they fought their way to St. Peter&rsquo;s
  Street, driving the enemy before them. On
  reaching the heath at the north end of the town,
  the Yorkists made a stand, and, after a furious
  struggle, were put to the rout. Warwick lost
  Sir John Grey of Groby, and 2,300 men. King
  Henry was rescued from the hands of Warwick,
  but Margaret ungenerously executed his warders,
  Lord Bonville, and the veteran Sir Thomas
  Kyriel, although the King had pledged his word
  for their safety.</p>
<p>Margaret reached Barnet, but London feared
  her and her rude army. When she sent for
  &ldquo;victuals and Lenten stuff,&rdquo; the mayor and
  sheriffs obeyed her orders, but the commons
  stopped the carts at Cripplegate. March and
  Warwick were drawing near, London would not
  admit her army, and Margaret &ldquo;fled northward,
  as fast as she might, towards York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry was deposed by the Yorkists, and the
  Earl of March declared King in his stead. Edward
  IV. carried on the war with vigour. Norfolk
  visited his estates to raise troops; Warwick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> marched out with the vanguard, the infantry followed,
  and lastly, on the 12th of March, Edward
  issued out of Bishopgate with the rear-guard.</p>
<p>On the 28th of March Lord Fitzwalter secured
  Ferrybridge, but at daybreak the Lancastrians
  fell on: Fitzwalter was slain as he issued from
  his tent, in his night gear, to quell, as he thought,
  a quarrel of his rude soldiery. Clifford pressed
  the fugitives furiously, and they carried a panic
  into the camp of Edward, that was only arrested
  when Warwick slew his horse, swearing upon the
  cross-hilt of his sword, that, &ldquo;Who would might
  flee; but he would tarry with all who were prepared
  to stand and fight the battle out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troops recovered courage, and Edward
  proclaimed freedom to depart for all who desired
  to quit before the battle; threatening severe
  punishments to any who, remaining, manifested
  fear in the presence of the enemy. Such cowards
  were to be slain by their companions. No man
  accepted the permission to retire.</p>
<p>Lord Fauconbridge then fell upon Clifford,
  defeated him, and recovered the post. During
  the retreat Clifford paused, to remove his gorget,
  and was struck on the throat, and slain, by a
  headless arrow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>Edward crossed the river, and confronted the
  enemy on Towton field. The Lancastrians were
  formed on an elevated ridge between Towton
  and Saxton, and presenting a front some two
  miles in extent. The Yorkists occupied a neighbouring
  ridge. A broad battle-space lay between
  the two armies.</p>
<p>The villagers were at mass in Saxton Church
  when &ldquo;the celebration with palms and spears
  began,&rdquo; for it was Palm Sunday. The heavy
  clouds hung low in the sombre sky, and as the
  wind arose the snow began to fall heavily, and
  was driven full into the faces of the Lancastrians.</p>
<p>It was nine o&rsquo;clock when, from the heavy
  masses of Edward&rsquo;s army, looming portentiously
  through the thickened air, the flight arrows descended
  upon the Lancastrians, and mingled with
  the wind-driven snow. In an instant the snow
  was red with blood, and dead and wounded men
  encumbered the ground.</p>
<p>Falconberg having advanced his archers, and
  struck the first blow, retired them, drawing the
  Lancastrian fire. The Queen&rsquo;s archers shot
  fierce and fast, but uselessly exhausted their
  quivers, when the Yorkists took a terrible revenge,
  pouring a deadly sleet of arrows upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> their enemies. It is said that they drew the
  Lancastrian arrows from the soil, leaving a few
  to impede the Queen&rsquo;s advance.</p>
<p>Somerset determined to close, and ordered a
  general advance. Knights dashed from point to
  point along the lines; Northumberland and Trollope
  closed their decimated ranks, and moved to
  the attack. Edward&rsquo;s army had suffered little,
  and was kept well in hand. It advanced steadily
  to meet the tide of war that surged madly forward
  through the mirk air and falling snow.</p>
<p>King Edward commanded the centre: the
  lion of England crested his helmet, he carried a
  long lance, with a peculiar vamplate, and the
  crimson velvet housings of his steed were powdered
  with suns and white roses. When the armies
  joined battle, he dismounted, and fought on foot.
  Warwick commanded the right wing, Lord
  Falconberg the left, and Sir John Denman
  and Sir John Venloe were in charge of the rear-guard</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if battle were the gate of Paradise, and
  the future an incomprehensible dream, they raised
  against each other a tumultuous shout of execration
  and defiance.&rdquo; The front ranks struck, with
  shivering of knightly lances on the wings, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> with
  deadly play of mauls, of bills and pikes in the van. The slaughter
  was dreadful: the moans of the dying were drowned in the clashing of
  steel, fierce war-cries, and the rush of stormy winds.
  Savagely assailed, and beaten by the pitiless,
  incessant snow, the Lancastrians valiantly maintained
  their ground, although their original superiority
  in numbers was more than balanced by
  their first losses and their exposed position. The
  front ranks fought desperately, for Edward of
  York had issued orders that no quarter should
  be extended to the vanquished. The archers
  of York poured their last arrows into the rear
  of the Queen&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>Norfolk should have commanded the van, but,
  seized with a sudden sickness, he had remained
  at Pontefract with the rear-guard. His orders
  were to bring forward his command, with any
  reinforcements that might reach him. Edward
  anxiously awaited his arrival. The battle raged
  for hours; the imprisoned peasantry in Saxton
  Church fearfully awaited the end; and Edward
  was scarcely less anxious, for the murderous
  butchery of the hand-to-hand fight favoured
  neither army. Norfolk was steadily marching
  through the wintery weather with his hardy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> soldiers, and messenger after messenger reached
  him requesting him to hurry up the reserves.</p>
<p>The form of battle was lost, as the two hosts
  were locked in the sanguinary struggle. The
  dark and stormy day was glooming to a wild and
  early night, when a louder tumult of battle rose
  on the Lancastrian left flank at North Acres.
  Norfolk was on the field, and had struck his
  enemy. The Lancastrians could not bear up
  under the augmented storm, and the retreat commenced.
  In the confusion the retiring wings
  struck each other, and the difficulties of the position
  were increased. Edward urged his infuriated
  soldiery to unsparing vengeance, and the Lancastrians
  turned again and again upon their pursuers.
  Ere they reached the river Cock&mdash;a tributary of
  the Wharfe&mdash;the Lancastrian army had merged
  into a dense and tumultuary crowd of fugitives,
  upon whose flank and rear the Yorkists hung with
  the blood-thirsty fury of barbarians. On reaching
  the stream the massacre became frightful, and the
  waters were tinged with gore and darkened with
  the slain, and are stated to have communicated
  their dreadful burthen and sanguinary stains to the
  Wharfe. For three days the Lancastrians were
  hunted out and butchered by the victors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>On the gloomy night of that fatal 29th of
  March, 1461, a stormy rout of knights and men-at-arms
  urged their jaded war-horses through the
  narrow streets of York, calling loudly upon the
  King and Queen to mount in hot haste and ride
  for their lives. That night the King and Queen,
  with the young prince, rode through Bootham,
  through the gloom of Galtres forest, fugitives, <i>en
  route</i> for Scotland.</p>
<p>The total loss was computed at 40,000 souls,
  the Lancastrians being heavily in excess. The
  death-roll contains the names of the Earls of
  Northumberland, Westmoreland, and Shrewsbury;
  of Lords Dacres and Wells, and Sir Andrew
  Trollope.</p>
<p>At York Edward executed the Earls of Devonshire
  and Ormond, Sir Baldwin Fulford, Sir
  William Talboys, and Sir William Hill. The
  Earl of Wiltshire suffered at Newcastle on the
  1st of May. The heads of York and Salisbury
  were replaced by those of Devonshire and Hill.</p>
<p>According to tradition, &ldquo;The Lord Dacres was
  slain in Nor-acres.&rdquo; Having removed his gorget
  he was shot in the throat by the cross-bow bolt
  of a lad lurking behind a burtree, or elder-bush.</p>
<p>The blood and snow froze on the field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> Towton, and when the thaw came the furrows
  overflowed with mingling blood and water.
  The slain were buried in vast pits; and there
  is a strange legendary belief that the roses
  which so persistently flourish upon the field,
  and the petals of which are pure white, slightly
  flushed with red, sprang from the commingling
  blood of the partisans of the red and white roses.</p>
<p>Edward was duly crowned, but his throne was
  threatened by the plots of the Lancastrians, although
  he kept the headsman&rsquo;s axe steadily at
  work. In 1462 the Scots caused some trouble in the
  North; and, towards the close of the year, Margaret
  appeared in arms, but precipitately retired without
  being able to make head against the King.</p>
<p>In 1464 Margaret again appeared in the
  North, when the gallant Sir Ralph Percy was
  slain on Hedgeley Moor, fighting for the red
  rose. The battle of Hexham followed a rout
  of the Lancastrians, whose leaders, Somerset,
  Ross, and Hungerford, were executed.</p>
<p>Sir Ralph Grey having betrayed Bamborough
  Castle to the Queen, and then defended it against
  Edward, was executed at Doncaster.</p>
<p>Margaret escaped, but Henry ultimately fell into
  Edward&rsquo;s hands, and was committed to the Tower.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII_YORKSHIRE_UNDER_THE" id="XIII_YORKSHIRE_UNDER_THE">XIII.&mdash;YORKSHIRE UNDER THE
  TUDORS.</a></h2>
<p>Edward IV. disgusted the Earl of Warwick
  by espousing Elizabeth, widow of
  Sir John Grey, of Groby, and the Yorkshire
  rising, known as the Thrave of St. Leonard,
  followed. The defeat and death of the royal
  captains, the Earls of Devon and Pembroke, was
  succeeded by Edward&rsquo;s confinement in Middleham
  Castle, and his escape to the Continent,
  when Warwick restored King Henry to the
  throne. On the 14th March, 1471, Edward
  landed at Ravenser Spurn and defeated Warwick
  at the battle of Barnet, when the king-maker and
  his brother Montacute were slain. On the day
  of Barnet, Queen Margaret, her son and his
  bride, landed at Weymouth, and the battle of
  Tewkesbury was fought on the 4th May, when
  Prince Edward was slain, and Queen Margaret
  captured. Edward was now firmly fixed upon
  the throne, and in 1478 he requited the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> treacheries of his brother Clarence by procuring
  his condemnation on a charge of high treason.
  Clarence perished in the Tower, either being
  drowned in a butt of wine, or permitted to drink
  himself to death. On the 9th of April, 1483,
  Edward IV. departed this life, leaving two sons,
  Edward and Richard. Richard, Duke of Gloucester,
  promptly appeared upon the scene, seized
  Lord Rivers, the Queen&rsquo;s brother, and Lord
  Grey, her son, and sent them to Pontefract,
  where they were executed. Procuring possession
  of the persons of his nephews, he caused them to
  be murdered, and usurped the throne. Nemesis
  followed him; he lost his only son, and was
  defeated and slain at Bosworth Field by Henry
  Tudor, who espoused Elizabeth, daughter of
  Edward IV., and was crowned under the title of
  Henry VII. Richard had proclaimed John
  De-la-Pole, Earl of Lincoln, heir presumptive to
  the throne, but this unfortunate nobleman was
  slain at the Battle of Stoke, ostensibly fighting in
  the cause of the Pretender, Lambert Simnel.
  The wars of the Roses were now ended, and
  Henry concluded the series of diabolical tragedies
  by obtaining the condemnation and execution of
  the Earl of Warwick, Clarence&rsquo;s son, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> lineal heir to the throne. He was judicially
  murdered on the 24th November, 1499.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s love of gold led to a revolt in Yorkshire, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1489, when the people, furious against
  the imposition of a tax, murdered the Earl of
  Northumberland, and took up arms; to be
  defeated and severely punished.</p>
<p>Henry VIII. succeeded to the throne, and by
  the suppression of the monasteries roused the
  indignation of the Yorkshire people, who made
  an armed remonstrance, known as the Pilgrimage
  of Grace. But for the moderation of the people,
  Henry&rsquo;s throne might have been overturned, and
  His Majesty requited their loyalty by wholesale
  executions, and by hanging Sir Robert Constable
  over the Beverley gate at Hull, and executing
  Robert Aske at York. Another of the leaders,
  Lord Darcy, was executed on Tower Hill.</p>
<p>The reign of Edward VI. witnessed a tumultuary
  outbreak at Seamer, consequent upon
  changes that had been made in the forms of
  religious worship. It was promptly put down by
  troops from York, and the ringleaders were
  executed.</p>
<p>During the reign of Queen Mary there was
  some little excitement in Yorkshire, consequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> upon Sir Thomas Wyat&rsquo;s insurrection, when
  Thomas, son of Lord Stafford, seized Scarborough
  Castle, and paid with his life for the daring
  exploit.</p>
<p>The nation was sorely disturbed by the complications
  resulting from the lust and religion of
  Henry VIII., when Elizabeth ascended the
  throne, and Her Majesty&rsquo;s interference with the
  affairs of Scotland, and her imprisonment of Mary
  Stuart, added to the difficulties of the position.</p>
<p>The Northern Rising, headed by Thomas
  Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and Charles
  Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, occurred in
  November, 1569, and was promptly suppressed,
  and followed by the customary severities.</p>
<p>Fortunately royal lines die out, and with
  Elizabeth the Tudors ceased; but only to entail
  upon the nation the wars and revolutions resulting
  from the follies of the Stuarts.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV_THE_BATTLE_OF_TADCASTER" id="XIV_THE_BATTLE_OF_TADCASTER">XIV.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF TADCASTER.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1642.</h3>
<p>When Charles I. visited Hull in 1639, he
  was most loyally received by the people;
  but his second visit, on the 23rd of April, 1642,
  ended in a bitter disappointment, and brought on
  the resort to arms. His power had waned, the
  Star Chamber was a tyranny of the past; Stafford
  was surrendered to the block, and Laud was in
  prison.</p>
<p>Before Charles reached the town, he was
  requested to defer his visit, and on appearing before
  the Beverley gate, he found it closed, the drawbridge
  raised, shotted cannon frowning upon him,
  pikemen and musketeers holding the ramparts.</p>
<p>Sir John Hotham dare not for his life admit the
  King. Vain the orders, the threats, the persuasions
  of Charles; he was compelled to retire,
  after commanding the garrison to hurl the traitor
  over the walls. Sir John was deeply distressed;
  he had heard himself proclaimed a traitor by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> royal heralds, who sounded trumpets before the
  walls.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of June, the nobility and gentry of
  Yorkshire met the King on Heworth Moor, and
  from that day the nation was virtually in arms.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of July, the Royalists occupied
  Hull Bridge, and the &ldquo;Providence&rdquo; entered the
  Humber with military stores for the King.
  Hotham attempted to capture the stores, but his
  troops were driven back, and the munitions of
  war were carted to York, being escorted by a
  large force of the King&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>Shortly after Hull was besieged, and the banks
  of the river being cut, the country around was
  submerged. Batteries were erected and the town
  cannonaded, but with little effect. As the month
  waned, sorties were organised, and the royal lines
  penetrated. One day the foot were scattered
  and the royal cavalry had to retire to Beverley.
  Reinforcements from London encouraged Sir
  John Meldrum, who assisted in the defence, in
  repeating the sorties. On one occasion the Earl
  of Newport was hoisted out of his saddle by a
  cannon ball, and hurled into a ditch. He was
  with difficulty rescued, being reduced to a state of
  insensibility. The siege was raised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p>At Nottingham, on the 25th of August, Charles
  raised his standard. It was blood-red, bore the
  royal arms, quartered, with a hand pointing to the
  endangered crown, and the motto, &ldquo;Give to
  CÃ¦sar his due.&rdquo; It was almost instantly levelled
  with the ground as a sudden blast of wind swept
  with a weird moaning across the face of the hill.</p>
<p>Cumberland maintained the King&rsquo;s cause in the
  loyal North, and to counteract his influence,
  Parliament appointed Lord Fairfax to the command
  of the Northern forces, his son, Sir Thomas,
  acting as General of Horse.</p>
<p>Various skirmishes ensued, Fairfax operating
  from his head-quarters at Tadcaster. On one
  occasion the loyal city of York was insulted by
  one of Fairfax&rsquo;s officers, who fired a pistol in
  Micklegate Bar.</p>
<p>At Wetherby, the younger Fairfax was surprised
  by Sir Thomas Glemham, but the
  explosion of a powder magazine induced the
  Royalists to draw off. Sir Thomas was in great
  peril, being repeatedly fired upon at close
  quarters. Major Carr, of the King&rsquo;s army, was
  slain, and the Parliamentarian Captain Atkinson
  was mortally wounded, his thigh being fractured
  by the repeated blows of pistols.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>The Earl of Newcastle assuming the command
  of the Cavaliers, attacked Fairfax at Tadcaster.
  A bridge over the Wharfe led to the main street
  of Tadcaster, and Fairfax cast up a breastwork to
  command this bridge, while he posted musketeers
  in a number of houses that flanked the position.
  The attack commenced on the morning of Tuesday,
  the 7th of December, eight hundred
  Parliamentarians withstanding the numerous army
  of Newcastle. When Fairfax beheld Newcastle&rsquo;s
  cavaliers marching down the York Road, and
  over the fields on each side, he resolved to
  evacuate the town, perceiving the impossibility of
  holding it against so numerous an enemy. It
  was, however, too late to retire in the face of the
  enemy, and the troops had barely time to occupy
  the position at the bridge before Newcastle made
  a determined attack upon them. Planting two
  demi-culverins to command the bridge, and
  hurrying up his infantry, Newcastle opened the
  ball at eleven o&rsquo;clock. For five hours the
  cavaliers attacked, and the Parliamentarians
  as gallantly defended the position.</p>
<p>Again and again the King&rsquo;s men came steadily
  on, with pikes in the front, and the musketeers
  firing and reloading with the most determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> courage; but ere they could reach the breastwork
  the brave men of Nunappleton and Denton, and
  the stout-hearted burghers of Bradford and
  Bingley, smote them with a storm of shot,
  shattered and thinned their ranks&mdash;sending them
  back to re-form and renew the attack with the
  same obstinate but unavailing courage. After a
  while the fight slackened, the Royalists lining the
  hedges and maintaining a brisk exchange of shot
  with their adversaries.</p>
<p>It was important that Newcastle should effect a
  lodgment within the lines of defence by carrying
  the houses on the river banks, and several
  desperate attempts to effect this were made.
  Some fierce conflicts resulted, and many men
  were slain. At length Newcastle carried one of
  the houses that commanded the main body of the
  Parliamentarians. In this strait, Major-General
  Gifford was ordered forward to retake the lost
  positions. Some heavy fighting at close quarters
  ensued, and pike and sword were red with blood,
  and the soil cumbered with the slain and wounded,
  before the stubborn Royalists were driven out,
  and the buildings re-occupied.</p>
<p>As the shades of evening closed over the
  mournful scene of slaughter and confusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> Newcastle sent forward another party against one of
  the houses. It was his last effort, and was
  gallantly made; but the hail of bullets smote so
  fiercely in the face of the division, that it was
  driven back in confusion, with some loss of men,
  including Captain Lister, a young and promising
  officer, whose death was deeply lamented.</p>
<p>Newcastle drew off, intending to renew the
  attack on the following morning. Upwards of a
  hundred dead and wounded men were left upon
  the field.</p>
<p>Lord Fairfax retained the honours of the field,
  but was compelled to retire his forces, and accordingly
  occupied the town of Selby. His position
  was extremely precarious, and he was deeply
  distressed by the necessity of leaving the towns of
  the West exposed to the attacks of their powerful
  enemies.</p>

<h2><a name="XV_THE_BATTLE_OF_LEEDS" id="XV_THE_BATTLE_OF_LEEDS">XV.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF LEEDS.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1643.</h3>
<p>On the 14th December, Sir Thomas Fairfax
  and the gallant Captain Hotham sallied
  out of Selby, and stormed Sherborne, to come
  back on the spur, closely pursued by the enraged
  Goring.</p>
<p>Sir William Savile, of Thornhill, compelled
  Leeds and Wakefield to surrender; and on Sunday,
  December 18th, attacked Bradford with 200
  foot, six troops of dragoons, and five of horse.
  A spirited engagement ensued, and the Royalists
  were beaten off. Shortly after, Sir Thomas made
  a night-march through the Royalist lines, and
  entered Bradford with 300 foot and three troops
  of horse.</p>
<p>Reinforced by numerous recruits Sir Thomas
  resolved to attack Sir William Savile, who was
  strongly entrenched in Leeds. The approaches
  from the Bridge and Hunslet Lane were defended
  by breastworks, and two demi-culverins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> commanded the long, broad Briggate, or principal
  street.</p>
<p>On Monday, January 23rd, 1643, Fairfax
  summoned the town with 2,000 clubmen, 1,000
  musketeers, six troops of horse, and three of
  dragoons at his back. Sir William Savile rejoined
  by a gallant defiance, having 1,500 foot
  and 500 horse posted in the town. Sir Thomas
  had formed his troops in two divisions to storm
  both sides of the town, and they advanced to
  attack as a snow-storm burst over the moor.</p>
<p>The watchword was &ldquo;Emanuel,&rdquo; and with
  sounding trumpets Sergeant-Major Forbes and
  Captain Hodgson fell on at the head of five
  companies of foot and one of dismounted
  dragoons. They were saluted with a volley of
  musketry, all but inoperative. The musketeers
  had aimed too high.</p>
<p>The roar of battle rose at the end of Ludgate,
  when Sir William Fairfax and Sir Thomas Norcliffe
  assaulted the entrenchments, and was answered
  from the south side of the river, where
  the stormers were fighting their way to the south
  end of the bridge. Here they established themselves,
  and flanked the defenders of the works
  at the north-end of the bridge, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> holding Forbes and his stormers in check. Sir
  William Savile ordered up one of the demi-culverins,
  and planted it upon the bridge, to
  arrest the Parliamentarian advance. Maitland,
  who led the attack, despatched a party of
  dragoons to the waterside, and compelled the
  defenders of the lower breastwork to retire, when
  Forbes occupied the deserted position. Schofield,
  a minister of Halifax, celebrated this success by
  singing a verse of the lxvii. psalm; and as it was
  concluded the cheers of the dragoons announced
  the evacuation of the upper breastwork. Still
  singing the psalm, Forbes charged up the Briggate,
  and captured the demi-culverins. Here
  they were met by Sir William Fairfax, who had
  gallantly forced his way into the town.</p>
<p>Fairfax had stormed three positions, and captured
  Leeds, after three hours of close fighting.
  His conduct was highly eulogised.</p>
<p>Sir William Savile and the Rev. Mr. Robinson
  swam their horses across the Aire, and escaped.
  Unhappily Captain Beaumont was drowned in
  the attempt.</p>
<p>Fairfax lost about twenty men, and took 460
  prisoners, the two demi-culverins, a number of
  muskets, and fourteen barrels of gunpowder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> The prisoners were allowed to depart on engaging
  not to arm against Parliament.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Fairfax being in delicate health
  returned to the head-quarters at Selby. Newcastle
  withdrew from Wakefield, and concentrated
  his army at York, leaving the country between
  Selby and the West open to the Fairfaxes, who
  occupied Howley Hall, between Wakefield and
  Bradford.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1643.</h3>
<p>While the Fairfaxes held Selby, Queen
  Henrietta landed at Bridlington, where
  she was briskly cannonaded by Vice-Admiral
  Batten, whose ungallant conduct was generally
  reprobated. Fairfax offered her Majesty an
  escort of Yorkshire Parliamentarians.</p>
<p>The plots of the Hothams closed Hull to the
  Fairfaxes, and they resolved to march to Leeds,
  a distance of twenty miles, although exposed to a
  flank attack. Sir Thomas drew off the enemy by
  marching a division in the direction of Tadcaster,
  thus enabling Lord Fairfax to carry the main
  body to Leeds.</p>
<p>The Royalists believed that Sir Thomas had
  designs upon York, and Goring followed hot upon
  his track, and on Whin Moor, near the village of
  Seacroft, charged his rear and right flank, and
  dispersed the Parliamentarians, of whom a few
  were wounded or slain, and many were captured.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>After a sharp pursuit and some shrewd blows,
  Sir Thomas Fairfax and Sir Henry Foulis reached
  Leeds with a few troopers.</p>
<p>Chiefly for the purpose of obtaining prisoners
  for the exchange of his captured soldiers, Sir
  Thomas resolved to make an attempt upon Wakefield,
  then held by Goring with seven troops of
  horse and six regiments of foot. Outworks,
  trenches, breastworks, and several cannon
  defended the town.</p>
<p>The Royalist officers were given to drinking
  and playing at bowls, and although aware of Fairfax&rsquo;s
  advance, he found some officers in liquor
  when the attack began. Doubtless this refers to
  the few; the majority would be on the alert like
  gallant and loyal gentlemen.</p>
<p>At midnight on Saturday, the 20th of May,
  Sir Thomas marched from Howley with 1,500
  horse and foot, drawn from the garrisons of Leeds,
  Bradford, Halifax, and Howley. At four o&rsquo;clock,
  he approached Wakefield, to find the enemy on
  the alert. Driving a body of horse out of Stanley,
  he assailed Wrengate and Northgate. Major-General
  Gifford, Sir Henry Foulis, Sir William
  Fairfax, and other brave officers, supported Sir
  Thomas. The stormers were saluted by a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> fire from muskets and cannon, but suffered little
  thereby. Undaunted by their hot reception, the
  stormers faced the hail of shot and fell on with
  pike and musket, capturing the works and turning
  the guns upon the enemy. Driving the cavaliers
  before him, Fairfax cleared the streets, capturing,
  with many others, General Goring, Sir Thomas
  Bland, Lieut.-Colonel Sir Geo. Wentworth,
  Lieut.-Colonel Saint George, Lieut.-Colonel Macmoyler,
  Sergt.-Major Carr, Captains Carr, Knight,
  Wildbore, Rueston, Pemberton, Croft, Ledgard,
  Lashley, Kayley, and Nuttall; Captn.-Lieut.
  Benson, Sergt.-Major Carnabie. Left wounded
  in Wakefield, upon their engagement to be true
  prisoners, Lieutenants Munckton, Thomas, Wheatley,
  Kent, Nicholson; Ensigns Squire, Vavasor,
  Masken, Lampton, Ducket, Stockhold, Baldwinson,
  Davis, Carr, Gibson, Smathweight, Ballinson,
  Watson, Smelt, Hallyburton, and Cornet Wivell.</p>
<p>Too weak to retain his conquest, Fairfax
  marched off in triumph with his prisoners,
  captured cannon, colours, arms, ammunition, etc.</p>
<p>London greatly rejoiced on receiving news of the
  victory. Parliament ordered public thanksgivings
  to be observed in the city; and in the churches
  and chapels narratives of the action were read.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<p>The following is the official account of the
  battle, as made to Lord Fairfax: &ldquo;On Saturday
  night, the 20th of May, the Lord General Fairfax
  gave orders for a party of 1,000 foot, three companies
  of dragoons, and eight troops of horse,
  to march from the garrison of Leeds, Bradford,
  Halifax, and Howley; Sir Thomas Fairfax
  commanded in chief. The foot were commanded
  by Sergt.-Major-General Gifford and Sir William
  Fairfax. The horse were divided into two bodies,
  four troops commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax,
  and the other four troops by Sir Henry
  Foulis; Howley was the rendezvous, where they
  all met on Saturday last, about twelve o&rsquo;clock of
  night; about two next morning they marched
  away, and coming to Stanley, where two of the
  enemy&rsquo;s troops lay, with some dragoons, that
  quarter was beaten up, and about one-and-twenty
  prisoners taken. About four o&rsquo;clock in the morning
  we came before Wakefield, where, after some
  of their horse were beaten into the town, the foot,
  with unspeakable courage, beat the enemies from
  the hedges, which they had lined with musketeers,
  into the town, and assaulted it in two places,
  Westgate and Northgate, and after an hour and a
  half fight, we recovered one of their pieces, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> turned
  it upon them, and entered the town at both places at one and the same
  time. When the baracadoes were opened, Sir Thomas Fairfax,
  with the horse, fell into the town, and cleared the
  street, when Colonel Goring was taken by Lieut.
  Alured, brother to Captain Alured, a member of
  the house; yet in the Market Place there stood
  three troops of horse and Colonel Lampton&rsquo;s
  regiment, to whom Major-General Gifford sent a
  trumpet with offer of quarter, if they would lay
  down their arms. They answered they scorned
  the motion. Then he fired a piece of their own
  ordnance upon them, and the horse fell in among
  them, beat them out of the town, and took all
  their officers, expressed in the enclosed list,
  twenty-seven colours of foot, three cornets of
  horse, and about 1,500 common soldiers. The
  enemy had in the town 3,000 foot and seven
  troops of horse, besides Colonel Lampton&rsquo;s
  regiment, which came into the town after he had
  entered the town. The enemy left behind them
  three pieces of ordnance, with ammunition, which
  we brought away.&mdash;Signed, Thomas Fairfax,

<h2><a name="XVII_THE_BATTLE_OF_ADWALTON" id="XVII_THE_BATTLE_OF_ADWALTON">XVII.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF ADWALTON
  MOOR.</a></h2>
<p>With an army of 12,000 men at his back
  the Marquis of Newcastle was bound to
  clear Yorkshire of the Parliamentarians. Having
  stormed Howley Hall, he marched upon Bradford,
  halting on Adwalton Moor on the 29th
  of June, 1643; making a careful disposition of
  his army, and placing his artillery in position, as
  though apprehensive of an attack from his active
  and daring opponents.</p>
<p>The audacity of the Fairfaxes was justified by
  their desperate position. Hull was closed to
  them by the defection of the Hothams; the
  open towns of the West were exhausted, and
  they were surrounded by enemies in the heart
  of a hostile country.</p>
<p>While Newcastle was encamping on Adwalton
  Moor, Fairfax was preparing to march upon him
  at four o&rsquo;clock on the following morning. The
  excitement in Bradford was intense. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> success of Fairfax could alone deliver them from
  the hands of the Royalists, who were deeply
  exasperated against the stubborn burghers.</p>
<p>The march of the Parliamentarians was delayed
  until eight o&rsquo;clock, in consequence of the tardiness
  or treachery of Major-General Gifford, if we may
  believe the grumblings of Sir Thomas Fairfax,
  who was doubtless impatient to be at the enemy.</p>
<p>The main body of the Cavaliers was posted
  before the hamlet of Adwalton, and a &ldquo;Forlorn
  Hope,&rdquo; as the advanced guard was called, held
  the Westgate Hill, half a mile distant from the
  army.</p>
<p>Here Fairfax dealt his first blow, and swept
  the Cavaliers before his advancing army. So
  first blood was claimed, and scattered on the
  turf lay the mangled forms of many brave men,
  their cold, still faces looking doubly pallid and
  sad in the bright morning sunshine.</p>
<p>Jutting out from the main road by Westgate
  Hill, Hodgson&rsquo;s Lane led up to Newcastle&rsquo;s
  position, and entered Warren&rsquo;s Lane, opening
  on the moor from Gomersal.</p>
<p>Lord Fairfax, with 3,000 men against 12,000,
  had to fight a defensive battle, and lining the
  hedges at the head of Warren&rsquo;s Lane with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> musketeers, he ordered Gifford to move down
  Hodgson&rsquo;s Lane upon Newcastle&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>The ground was scarcely occupied before twelve
  troops of cavalry swept across the moor, trumpets
  sounding, armour clashing, and the long, thin
  rapiers flashing back the morning&rsquo;s sun. Ere
  they reached the Roundheads, the muskets flashed
  from the hedge-rows, and as the white smoke
  drifted on the breeze, and the loud report rang
  out, the gallant Cavaliers retired with thinned
  and disordered ranks, leaving Colonel Howard
  and many other gallant men dead upon the
  field. Again they charged, again broke before
  the deadly fire of the musketeers, leaving
  another colonel upon the field. Then Fairfax
  charged, and bore them, sorely buffeted
  and cut-up, before his strong riders, until
  they found protection beneath the muzzle of
  their cannon.</p>
<p>Gifford was handling his infantry with such
  address that Newcastle&rsquo;s spirits drooped, and he
  thought of commanding a retreat. But he had
  bold, strong gentlemen beneath his banners, and
  Colonel Skerton, heading a stand of pikes, broke
  Gifford&rsquo;s ranks, and made deadly work as the
  royal horse followed his charge. The Parliamentarians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> were not allowed time to rally, but
  were driven into Bradford.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas had no order to retire, and was
  not aware of the defeat of his father&rsquo;s command.
  For some time he maintained his ground, and
  succeeded in carrying his troops into Halifax.</p>
<p>The next morning he was in Bradford. A
  day of heavy fighting followed, but the place
  could not be maintained. Sir Thomas attempted
  to pass through the royal lines, but his party was
  dispersed, and his wife captured by the enemy.
  He gained Leeds, where the news arrived that
  the Hothams had been arrested, and Hull was
  open to the Parliamentarians. The Fairfaxes
  resolved to make the attempt to reach the
  fortress, and succeeded after many perils, Sir
  Thomas being shot through the wrist during a
  skirmish, and fainting from excessive pain and
  loss of blood.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII_THE_BATTLE_AT_HULL" id="XVIII_THE_BATTLE_AT_HULL">XVIII.&mdash;THE BATTLE AT HULL.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1643.</h3>
<p>Newcastle marched upon Hull, drove
  Sir Thomas Fairfax out of Beverley, and
  besieged the town with 12,000 foot and 4,000
  horse, on the 2nd of September, 1643. Attempts
  were made to command the Humber by the
  erection of forts at Hessle and Paull, and red-hot
  shot were thrown into the town. A sally was
  beaten back, but the besiegers were hindered by
  the cutting of the banks of the Hull and Humber,
  when the country around was laid under water.
  Oliver Cromwell and Lord Willoughby of Parham
  visited the town to consult with the Fairfaxes
  as to the best measures for the defence, but appeared
  satisfied that it could be maintained. The
  sorties of the garrison were spirited, and attended
  with some success. On the 9th October the
  Royalists attempted to carry the town by escalade,
  and almost succeeded. The Charter
  House battery was stormed, but re-captured, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> many lives were lost. The gallant Captain
  Strickland was slain while leading the stormers.
  On the morning of the 11th of October a pitched
  battle was fought before the town. Fairfax
  organised a force of 1,500 men, drawn from the
  garrison, burghers, and the crews of the warships
  in the Humber.</p>
<p>Meldrum and Lord Fairfax issued out of the
  Hessle and Beverley gates, and took the Royalists
  by surprise, driving them out of their
  works; but being assailed by fresh troops from
  the main body of the besiegers, they were very
  roughly handled, and driven under the town
  walls, when the cannon opened upon the Cavaliers,
  and enabled Meldrum and Fairfax to
  re-form their troops.</p>
<p>Supported by the fire of the town guns, the
  Parliamentarians renewed their attack; and, in
  the face of a heavy fire, stormed the enemy&rsquo;s
  works, the dispute being very severe, and the
  fighting stubbornly maintained at close quarters.
  Newcastle&rsquo;s warriors made a gallant attempt to
  re-conquer their lost forts, but the cannon were
  turned upon them, and the Parliamentarians
  repulsed every attack. After three hours of
  hard fighting the Cavaliers retired, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> received over one hundred discharges of the town
  guns.</p>
<p>An anxious night was passed, for the Parliamentarians
  expected Newcastle to renew his
  attempts to regain his forts and cannon, but
  the Marquis had suffered heavily, and, taking
  council with his officers, resolved to abandon
  the siege, and retire under cover of the night.
  His main army retired upon York, securing the
  retreat by breaking down bridges and obstructing
  the roads.</p>
<p>The men of Hull rejoiced in the capture of
  two famous cannon, Gog and Magog, a demi-culverin,
  four small drakes mounted on one
  carriage, two large brass drakes, and a saker.</p>
<p>The burghers spent the following day in public
  thanksgiving, and thus observed the anniversary
  of their deliverance until the restoration of the
  Stuarts.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX_THE_BATTLE_OF_SELBY" id="XIX_THE_BATTLE_OF_SELBY">XIX.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF SELBY.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1644.</h3>
<p>In 1644 King and Parliament were so closely
  matched that any accession of strength to
  either party would tend to the speedy conclusion
  of the conflict. When, on the 4th of March, the
  Earl of Leven occupied Sunderland with 30,000
  Scots, reinforcements for Parliament, the greatest
  concern was felt by all good Cavaliers, and the
  Marquis of Newcastle promptly brought up his
  Yorkshire Royalists, and held Leven at bay.</p>
<p>In this strait Sir Thomas Fairfax was ordered
  to the North to reinforce the Scots with cavalry,
  and enable them to engage the King&rsquo;s men.
  Lord Fairfax joined his son near Hull, and,
  augmenting his forces, it was resolved to attack
  Selby, which was defended by barricades, and
  garrisoned by a strong force of foot and horse
  under the command of Colonel Bellasis, the son
  of Lord Falconberg.</p>
<p>On the 11th of April, 1644, the Parliamentarians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> advanced to the storm. The army was
  formed into three divisions, commanded by Lord
  Fairfax, Sir John Meldrum, and Colonel Bright.
  Sir Thomas Fairfax supported with his cavalry.</p>
<p>The steady advance was met by the red flash
  of the guns, and the smoke rose and drifted
  over the front. But the drums beat on, the
  pikemen held bravely to the front, and the
  musketeers began to handle their guns, as
  the front ranks poured into the trenches, leaving
  on the green sward behind them the silent forms
  of slain men, whose white, drawn faces looked very
  sad in the midst of the fresh young grass, and
  under the shifting April clouds. In the trenches
  and by the barricades some hot work went on,
  with clash of pikes and hail of bullets, until the
  Cavaliers were fairly beaten from their defences,
  and their reluctant officers, failing to rally their
  disordered ranks, retired them from the front.
  The lines were won, but Colonel Bellasis held
  the open ground with his horse, ready to sweep
  back the hostile foot should they attempt any
  further advance, and a desultory fire of musketry
  was maintained, until Sir Thomas Fairfax succeeded,
  after a fierce struggle, in breaking down
  a barricade and making way for his horse. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> the files of heavy cavalry came crashing over the
  disputed ground, beating under hoof the heaps
  of debris and rubbish, and overthrowing all who
  strove with pike and musket to bar their path.
  Sir Thomas occupied the ground between the
  houses and the river, when, with trumpets sounding
  the charge, a numerous body of royal horse
  bore down upon them. The charge was gallantly
  received, and a severe conflict ensued, when,
  beaten back by dint of steel and lead, the Royalists
  broke away in confusion, and availing
  themselves of the bridge of boats, crossed the
  river and took to flight.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the panting warriors time to
  re-form their disordered ranks before the fiery
  Bellasis burst upon them in a furious charge,
  eager to avenge his defeated horse. Cold steel
  met in thrust and parry; the pistols flashed, and
  brave men fell thickly as, hand-to-hand, in dust
  and smoke, the sharp hot <i>melee</i> held; then riderless
  steeds broke away from the shock; Sir
  Thomas was hurled from his steed amid plunging
  hoofs and slashing steel, but was rescued by his
  gallant troopers, and re-mounted. The Cavaliers
  fought as King&rsquo;s men should that day, but were
  over-weighted by Fairfax&rsquo;s heavy horse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> driven off in headlong flight for York, leaving
  Colonel Bellasis a prisoner in the hands of the
  victorious Roundheads.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Parliamentarian foot had
  made good their hold of the town, and accepted
  the surrender of the royal foot.</p>
<p>The results of this engagement were remarkable.
  The Fairfaxes had only defeated some
  two or three thousand men, and wrested a small
  town from the King&rsquo;s hands, yet the strong city
  of York trembled for its safety, and Newcastle
  was urgently requested to return and defend the
  county. He complied. The Scots were at liberty.
  Fairfax immediately joined them with his little
  army; and, on the 19th of April, York was blockaded
  by the combined forces. Manchester augmented
  the besieging army; York was closely
  invested, its fall was imminent; and King Charles
  urgently demanded of Prince Rupert the raising
  of the siege. Gallantly was the demand met,
  but was followed by the famous battle of Marston
  Moor, from the effects of which the royal cause
  never recovered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1644.</h3>
<p>King Charles was fully conscious of the
  perilous position in which he would be
  placed if York fell, and Yorkshire passed into
  the hands of the enemy; he therefore instructed
  Prince Rupert to march to the relief of York,
  using the following impressive language:&mdash;&ldquo;I

  affection which I know you bear me, that, all
  new enterprise laid aside, you immediately march,
  according to your first intention, with all your
  force to the relief of York; but if that be either
  lost, or have freed themselves from the besiegers,
  or that, for want of powder, you cannot undertake
  that work, that you immediately march with your
  whole strength to Worcester, to assist me and
  my army, without which, or your having relieved
  York by beating the Scots, all the successes you
  may afterwards have, most infallibly will be useless
  unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>Gathering up forces as he advanced, Rupert
  marched to the succour of the city, and occupied
  Knaresborough and Boroughbridge on the evening
  of the 30th of June. On the following
  morning the Parliamentarians drew up on Hessay
  Moor, to arrest Rupert&rsquo;s advance. Outgeneraling
  his adversaries, the Prince marched
  to Poppleton Ferry, halted his army, and entered
  York with 200 Cavaliers. That night a council
  of war was held, and Rupert resolved to give
  battle to the enemy. The Marquis of Newcastle
  endeavoured to dissuade the Prince from this
  step, and begged him to await the arrival of
  a reinforcement of 5,000 men, expected in the
  course of a few days. Rupert is accused of
  behaving with discourtesy towards Newcastle,
  and for this there can be no defence. There
  was, however, good reason for fighting, and at
  once. Certainly the Prince could not be expected
  to put a great value on Newcastle&rsquo;s
  advice. Rupert had achieved many successes,
  and had relieved York by a masterly movement;
  on the other hand, Newcastle had not achieved
  any remarkable success, and had allowed himself
  to be besieged in York without fighting a battle.
  If he could hold Leslie in check, surely he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> have attempted to raise the blockade of York
  before Manchester arrived with reinforcements.
  Had Rupert waited for reinforcements, would
  the Parliamentarians have accepted battle, or
  retired to some stronger position? Rupert was
  in a favourable position, with a tried army,
  almost as strong as that of the enemy, and if
  he did not at once give battle as favourable an
  opportunity might not again occur. Having relieved
  York, was he to retire and leave the
  enemy in Yorkshire to again besiege the city,
  or capture the various royal strongholds? Two
  nearly equal armies were opposed on Yorkshire
  soil, would one army leave the other in possession?
  would the Parliamentarians compel the
  Cavaliers to fight? or would the two armies
  move away in different directions, seeking other
  fields and other foes? Rupert and the Parliamentarian
  leaders knew that they were there to
  fight. The King&rsquo;s affairs absolutely demanded
  a victory, and the blame that attaches to Rupert
  is that he forgot the general in acting the part
  of a captain of horse, and so lost a battle that
  it was within his capabilities to have won, as
  the conduct of his army abundantly proved.</p>
<p>The morning of the 2nd of July beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> Rupert&rsquo;s army in motion; but the enemy were
  marching upon Tadcaster, not expecting an engagement.
  A threatening movement of Rupert&rsquo;s
  cavalry was promptly checked, and both armies
  began to form for battle under the Earls of
  Leven and Manchester and Lord Fairfax on
  the one hand; and Rupert, Goring, Lucas, and
  Sir John Urrie on the other. Some time elapsed
  before the various divisions reached the field,
  and stood opposed in order of battle.</p>
<p>The Parliamentarians occupied a gentle eminence
  covered by a crop of rye, beaten down by
  horse and foot. The regiments of Scotch and
  English were intermixed, that the grace or blame
  of victory or defeat might be equally shared.
  The centre consisted of serried masses of pikemen
  and musketeers, commanded by Leven and
  the elder Fairfax; Sir Thomas Fairfax led the
  right wing, consisting of his Yorkshire cavalry,
  supported by three regiments of Scottish horse,
  and outflanked by the village of Marston. The
  left wing, extending to Tockwith village, was
  commanded by Manchester and Cromwell. Their
  field word was &ldquo;God with us!&rdquo; Before them
  was the open moor, held by the King&rsquo;s men,
  but the furze and broken ground was calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> to retard their charges. Between the two armies
  extended a ditch and hedge, soon to be immortalised
  as the scene of some heavy fighting and
  dreadful slaughter.</p>
<p>Some uncertainty exists as to the disposition
  of the Royalists, the various accounts of the
  battle being very contradictory, but it may be
  assumed that the centre was commanded by
  Goring, Sir Charles Lucas, and General Porter;
  Newcastle heading his own regiment of white-coated
  pikemen. Rupert carried his huge red-cross
  banner, emblazoned with the arms of the
  Palatinate, on the left wing; and Sir John Urrie
  commanded the right. Grant seems disposed to
  support the statement of Rushworth, that Rupert
  led the right wing, and Sir Charles Lucas the
  left.</p>
<p>Rupert&rsquo;s position was excellent for the fighting
  of a defensive battle. To cross the ditch that
  lay between the armies was a serious undertaking
  for either army, but especially for the Parliamentarians,
  as Rupert had lined the hedge with
  musketeers, and had planted a battery on an
  eminence behind his centre, thus demanding a
  heavy sacrifice of life from the Parliamentarians
  before they could exchange blows with his centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> and, in the event of his assuming the offensive,
  the advance would be partially covered by the
  battery.</p>
<p>The combined armies consisted of about 46,000
  men, and were of almost equal strength, the
  Parliamentarians having, probably, some little
  advantage in numbers. For several hours no
  hostile movement took place, with the exception
  of a few discharges of cannon, by one of the
  first shots of which the loyal Sir Gilbert Houghton
  lost his son. Apparently both parties were
  awed by the importance of the impending conflict,
  and reluctant to make the first movement,
  with all the difficulties attending the passage of
  the ditch and hedge.</p>
<p>The pleasant summer afternoon waned into
  evening, peaceful and calm. Seven o&rsquo;clock
  approached: surely the bloody bout would be
  delayed until the morrow. Occasionally the cannon
  roared, and a few men fell; one of these
  unfortunates was young Walton, Cromwell&rsquo;s nephew,
  who was severely wounded; and it is
  supposed that this brought about the Parliamentarian
  attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was now between six and seven, and
  Rupert, calling for provisions, dismounted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> began to eat his supper. A large number of
  his followers did the like. Newcastle strolled
  towards his coach to solace himself with a pipe.
  Before he had time to take a whiff, the battle had
  begun.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Gardiner.</i></p>
<p>Manchester moved forward his infantry in
  heavy masses, with pikes and muskets ready for
  the deadly work, and attempted the passage of
  the ditch, while Cromwell&rsquo;s magnificent cuirassiers
  swept forward to clear the same formidable
  obstacle, and engage the enemy&rsquo;s right. Rupert
  hurried forward a large body of musketeers to
  meet Manchester&rsquo;s attack, and at the same time
  swept their ranks by the deadly discharges of his
  field battery. Rupert&rsquo;s musketeers being covered
  by the hedge, inflicted heavy loss upon the
  Parliamentarians, and Manchester vainly exerted
  himself to re-form their shattered ranks. Two
  cannons were hurried up, and the officers exposed
  themselves with the utmost devotion to
  encourage their troops, but they were powerless
  to advance in the face of that deadly shower of
  bullets, and the position was becoming critical
  in the extreme, when relief came, and that not
  a moment too soon. Cromwell, making a wide
  sweep, gained the open moor, found room for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> a charge, and bore down upon the enemy&rsquo;s
  right with a tremendous and fatal force. A short
  but desperate conflict ensued as Cromwell carried
  his Ironsides through the sorely buffeted and
  shattered squadrons of the royal horse. Pressing
  on, he stormed the battery and put the gunners
  to the sword. A moment&rsquo;s breathing space was
  allowed the horses, and then the musketeers, who
  held Manchester&rsquo;s advance in check with their
  forks planted in the ditch-bank, maintaining a
  steady and destructive fire, became the object
  of attack. These brave soldiers did not attempt
  to meet the charge, but retreated in close order,
  with presented pikes, and although they suffered
  severely from the fury of the enemy, they
  endeavoured to check the successive charges by
  the repeated fire of their muskets.</p>
<p>There was no braver man in the field than
  Sir Thomas Fairfax, but he suffered a sad defeat
  on that memorable July evening. The ground
  occupied by his troops was broken and intersected
  by a number of lanes; not difficult to
  defend, but preventing united action when the
  moment for the advance arrived. Nevertheless
  he struggled forward, wasting his strength by a
  succession of weak charges, but unable to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> room for a general attack. The fiery Rupert
  was opposed to him, and swept his ranks by a
  cruel and incessant fire of musketry, until little
  hope for the Parliament remained in this part
  of the field. For a time the impending ruin
  was averted by Cromwell, who charged the
  Prince&rsquo;s infantry, and afforded Fairfax an opportunity
  of re-forming his torn and wearied forces;
  but in the midst of the struggling advance of
  the over-mastered Parliamentarians Rupert delivered
  his grand charge, and storming over and
  through every obstacle, filled this part of the
  field with a wild rout of unhappy fugitives,
  amongst whom the keen rapiers of his gay
  Cavaliers wrought terrible havoc. The brother
  of Sir Thomas Fairfax was mortally wounded,
  but the good knight clung desperately to the
  ground with 500 of his own horse and a regiment
  of lancers, to be wounded and fairly borne
  off the field by the impetuous Rupert. Here
  the Prince took a deadly and fatal revenge on
  the Scotch cavalry, put them to headlong flight,
  and bore on in stormy pursuit, while the royal
  infantry was exposed to the attacks of Manchester&rsquo;s
  foot and Cromwell&rsquo;s victorious Ironsides.
  Had Rupert succoured his centre at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> stage of the battle he must have compelled the
  Parliamentarians to yield to him the victory.</p>
<p>Nobly the royal foot met the deadly storm of
  battle; exerting such heroic courage that they
  fairly pushed back the Parliamentarian advance,
  and the King&rsquo;s prospects were yet promising,
  maugre the terrible handling received from Cromwell.
  That gallant soldier held his cavalry well
  in hand, albeit their ranks were somewhat thinned
  by shot and steel; and they now wrested the
  victory from the rashly impetuous Rupert. The
  Marquis of Newcastle&rsquo;s incomparable regiment
  of Northumbrians perished here. They were
  known as &ldquo;lambs,&rdquo; or &ldquo;white-coats,&rdquo; from the
  colour of their doublets, and resisted Cromwell to
  the last. Again and again he charged them, but
  they returned blow for blow, and, disdaining all
  offers of quarter, perished almost to a man, the
  few that were saved owing their lives rather to
  the magnanimity of their enemies than to any
  exertions of their own to escape the slaughter.
  They fell in their proper battle-order, and presented
  a ghastly spectacle as they lay upon the
  field in rank and file, their white coats cruelly
  slashed with many a crimson stain. The remainder
  of the royal foot were now taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> the rear by the Ironsides, and sustained a bloody
  and ruinous defeat. Before their ruin was consummated
  the Prince returned, and a fierce conflict
  ensued. Rupert had counted the victory as
  already won, and rage and mortification added
  to the fury of the last sanguinary and stubborn
  conflict. Cromwell was wounded in the neck,
  and his charge was all but abortive, when Leslie
  came up and retrieved the mishap by a terrible
  onslaught that sent Rupert&rsquo;s over-mastered warriors
  in wild confusion from the field. The
  infantry now surrendered, and Cromwell captured
  all the cannon, baggage, &amp;c., of the royal army,
  which was pursued almost to the gates of York.</p>
<p>At a late hour throngs of wounded men and
  fugitives from the field appeared before Micklegate-Bar,
  but the soldiers of the garrison were
  alone admitted into the city, and the confusion
  that ensued was of the most deplorable and
  painful character.</p>
<p>Cromwell remained on the field, anxious and
  alert, fearful that the impetuous Rupert might
  rally some remains of his army, and, by a sudden
  onslaught under cover of night, wrest from his
  shattered army the victory so hardly won by dint
  of heavy fighting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>The general loss was estimated at 7,000 men,
  Prince Rupert losing over 3,000 slain, and 3,000
  prisoners, including many officers. The Parliamentarians
  captured forty-seven colours, twenty-five
  pieces of artillery, a number of carbines
  and pistols, 130 barrels of gunpowder, and 10,000
  arms. Among their prisoners were Generals
  Sir Charles Lucas, Tilliard, and Porter, and
  Lord Goring&rsquo;s son. Amongst the gallant gentlemen
  who laid down their lives for King Charles
  on Marston Moor were Lord Kerry, Sir Francis
  Dacres, Sir William Lampton, Sir Charles
  Slingsby, Sir William Wentworth, Sir Marmaduke
  Luddon, Sir Richard Gledhill, Colonel
  John Fenwick, Sir Richard Graham, and Captain
  John Baird. Sir Richard Gledhill, as a matter
  of fact, died in his own house an hour after he
  succeeded in gaining its shelter. He had received
  twenty-six wounds. Sir Charles Lucas was informed
  that he could select some of the slain for
  private interment, and in thus distinguishing one
  unfortunate Cavalier caused a bracelet of silky
  hair to be removed from his wrist, &ldquo;as he knew
  an honourable lady who would thankfully receive
  it.&rdquo; The Scots suffered severely, and the English
  lost Captains Micklethwaite and Pugh, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> Sir Thomas Fairfax had to deplore the loss of his
  brother Charles, and of Major Fairfax.</p>
<p>No two accounts of the battle agree, and Cromwell,
  whose conduct conduced so largely to the
  winning of the battle, has been even accused of
  cowardice by one writer. Rapin says, &ldquo;I shall not
  undertake to describe this battle, because in all
  the accounts I have seen I meet with so little
  order or clearness that I cannot expect to give
  a satisfactory idea of it to such of my readers as
  understand these matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Parliamentarians assumed a white badge
  to distinguish them from their opponents.</p>
<p>Prince Rupert would probably have won the
  battle had he acted as a commander-in-chief instead
  of leading a wing; but it was then customary
  for each of the three commanders to fight
  his own battle, with too little regard to the
  general issue, when there was no commander
  directing the operations of the divisions.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s affairs never recovered from the
  results of this battle, and the royal cause undoubtedly
  received its death-blow on Marston
  Moor, when the last of the Yorkshire battles
  was fought.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI_BATTLE_OF_BRUNNANBURGH" id="XXI_BATTLE_OF_BRUNNANBURGH">XXI.&mdash;BATTLE OF BRUNANBURGH.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 937.</h3>
<p>King Athelstan reigned in troublous days,
  with the restless Danish population in
  the North, the Welsh in the West, the Scots
  ready to support his enemies, and his own nobles
  discontented and disloyal. Athelstan had conferred
  upon Sithric, King of Northumberland, the
  hand of his sister; but the prince violated his
  obligations, and was only secured from punishment
  by the sudden stroke of death.</p>
<p>Sithric&rsquo;s sons, Anlaf and Godfrid, took refuge
  in Ireland and Scotland; and a confederation
  of the princes of Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and
  Cumberland, seconded by a Danish fleet, threatened
  the crown of Athelstan.</p>
<p>After four years of preparation and recruiting
  the storm burst. In 937 Anlaf entered the
  Humber at the head of a huge armada of 615
  sail, and occupied Bernicia.</p>
<p>Athelstan, with a powerful army, marched to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> the North and encamped at Brunanburgh. It
  is said that Anlaf entered the King&rsquo;s camp
  disguised as a minstrel, and was liberally rewarded
  by Athelstan, but, in his pride, buried
  the gold, and was perceived by one of the royal
  soldiers, who then recognised him, but permitted
  him to retire from the camp before he apprised
  Athelstan of the identity of the minstrel. His
  excuse that had permitted Anlaf to escape because
  he had at one period sworn fealty to him,
  was accepted as a sufficient reason; but Athelstan
  removed his camp, and shortly after the
  Bishop of Sherborne came up with his troops
  and occupied the ground that Athelstan had
  vacated.</p>
<p>That night Anlaf made a sudden attack upon
  the Saxons, and slew the Bishop of Sherborne and
  many of his followers, before he was driven off.</p>
<p>The day of battle dawned. Each army was
  formed into two corps. Athelstan commanded
  the West Saxons; Turketul, his heroic chancellor,
  led the warriors of Mercia and London.
  Anlaf and his wild Northmen opposed the King;
  Constantine, King of Scotland, confronted Turketul
  with his Scots and Cumbrians.</p>
<p>At sunrise the war-smiths fell to, with sleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> of arrows and deadly play of bills and spears,
  as the banners were pushed forward. Bravely
  the golden-haired Athelstan acquitted himself
  in the van, amid the communion of swords and
  the clashing of bills, the conflict of banners and
  the meeting of spears, when the keen javelins
  strewed the soil with the slain, and the unerring
  arrows carried death above the guarding shield.
  Athelstan&rsquo;s sword dropped in the press, but as
  Otho, Archbishop of Canterbury, entreated the
  heavenly aid, a sword of celestial potency filled
  the empty sheath, and with it Athelstan fought
  until night closed upon the scene.</p>
<p>As the day was drawing towards eventide,
  with the wild war-wrestle at its maddest, and
  the song of the fiery Northman rolling like
  thunder over the field, now heaped with slain
  and wounded men, for the front ranks had been
  mown down, and renewed again and again,
  Turketul headed a veteran corps of spearmen,
  and made an irresistible charge upon the Scots.
  Vainly Constantine strove to hold his ground;
  his fierce Scots were over-weighted, broken, and
  borne down. Anlaf&rsquo;s Northmen were dismayed,
  and gave ground. Turketul charged them; a
  brief, fierce struggle ensued; then he penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> their ranks; flight commenced; the field was
  covered with fugitives; the Northmen anxiously
  striving to regain their nailed barks, and crowd
  all sail for Ireland.</p>
<p>Then pressed the West Saxons hard on &ldquo;the
  footsteps of the loathed nations.&rdquo; &ldquo;They hewed
  the fugitives behind, amain, with swords mill-sharp,&rdquo;
  while on the battle-stead lay five &ldquo;youthful
  kings, and seven eke of Anlaf&rsquo;s earls.&rdquo;&ldquo;Constantine,
  hoary warrior, he had no cause to exult
  in the communion of swords. Here was his
  kindred band of friends o&rsquo;erthrown on the falkstead,
  in battle slain; and his son he left on the
  slaughter-place, mangled with wounds, young in
  the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slaughter was dreadful, but the throne of
  Athelstan was secured, and his northern subjects
  humbled. He left behind him a terrible carnage
  field, &ldquo;the sallowy kite the corse to devour, and
  the swarthy raven with horned nib, and the dusky
  &lsquo;pada&rsquo; erne white-tailed, the corse to enjoy,
  greedy war-hawk, and the grey beast, wolf of
  the wood. Carnage greater has not been in this
  island ever yet of people slain, before this, by
  edges of swords, as books us say, old writers,
  since from the east hither, Angles and Saxons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> came
  to land, o&rsquo;er the broad seas Britain sought, mighty war-smiths, the
  Welsh o&rsquo;ercame, earls most bold, this earth obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In later years Anlaf obtained considerable successes
  over King Edmund, and the northern
  provinces were ceded to him; but scarcely had
  he obtained this high position ere death touched
  his brow, and kingly pride and vain ambition were
  overcome.</p>
<p>Despite the labours of Yorkshire and Lancashire
  antiquaries, the locality of Brunanburgh
  must be regarded as unascertained, and no evidence
  has been produced that can justify its
  inclusion in the list of Yorkshire battles.</p>

  HEAD.</a></h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1779.</h3>
<p>In the years 1778 and 1779 British commerce
  suffered severely from the attacks of Paul
  Jones.</p>
<p>In September of the latter year he cruised
  along the East coast with the &ldquo;Bonne Homme
  Richard,&rdquo; 40 guns, 375 men; the &ldquo;Alliance,&rdquo; 40
  guns, 300 men; the &ldquo;Pallas,&rdquo; 32 guns, 275
  men; and the &ldquo;Vengeance,&rdquo; 12 guns, 70 men.
  On the 20th of September, Bridlington was
  alarmed by an express stating that Paul Jones
  was off Scarborough; that evening he was seen
  by the fishermen of Flamborough, and a fleet of
  merchantmen crowded into Bridlington bay, and
  the harbour was soon thronged with vessels, a
  number being chained alongside the piers. The
  townsfolks mustered, rudely armed, and supported
  the two companies of Northumberland Militia,
  who marched to the quay with drums beating.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>The Baltic fleet, with a freight valued at
  Â£600,000 pounds, was approaching the coast,
  convoyed by the &ldquo;Serapis,&rdquo; 40 guns, captain,
  Pearson; and the &ldquo;Countess of Scarborough,&rdquo;
  20 guns, captain, Piercy. On Thursday, September
  23rd, the fleet approached Scarborough,
  and was warned by the bailiff that the enemy
  was in the neighbourhood. Captain Pearson
  then signalled the fleet to bear down upon his
  lee, but the ships continued their course. About
  noon a scene of confusion ensued as the leading
  ships perceived the enemy bearing down upon
  them. The two captains hoisted all sail, prepared
  for action, and took the post of danger.</p>
<p>Twilight was closing over waves and cliff
  when, at about twenty minutes past seven, the
  &ldquo;Serapis&rdquo; challenged the &ldquo;Bonne Homme
  Richard,&rdquo; and saluted him with a cannon shot.
  The American flag was run up, and the shot
  returned. Captain Pearson delivered a broadside,
  which was returned, and for some time the battle
  was carried on by repeated discharges of cannon.
  The moon arose with unusual brilliancy, and the
  natives of Flamborough thronged to the cliffs to
  witness the exciting scene. Paul Jones attempted
  to board, but with bayonet, pike, and cutlass the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> British tars maintained their decks, and the
  &ldquo;Bonne Homme Richard&rdquo; sheered off. An
  attempt to lay the &ldquo;Serapis&rdquo; square with her
  adversary was foiled, and the &ldquo;Bonne Homme
  Richard&rdquo; was laid across the bows of the &ldquo;Serapis.&rdquo;
  With cannon and small arms a murderous
  conflict was maintained, then the jib-boom of the
  &ldquo;Serapis&rdquo; gave way, and the ships fell broadside
  to broadside, with yard-arms locked; swaying
  and reeling as they ripped up each other&rsquo;s sides
  with repeated broadsides, although the muzzles
  of the cannons touched, and many of the port-lids
  were torn away.</p>
<p>The night closed in, and the conflict continued.
  The decks of the &ldquo;Serapis&rdquo; were swept by shot,
  covered with the slain and wounded. For two
  hours her crew maintained the fight with heroic
  courage. Combustibles were thrown upon her
  decks, ten times she took fire; a hand-grenade
  exploded a cartridge, and the explosion ran along
  the line of guns where the cartridges lay, abaft the
  mainmast. Many men were killed or wounded,
  and the guns remained unfought to the end.</p>
<p>During this murderous work the &ldquo;Alliance&rdquo;
  sailed round and round the combatants, and raked
  the &ldquo;Serapis&rdquo; with successive broadsides.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>On a cry for quarter being raised, Captain
  Pearson boarded the &ldquo;Bonne Homme Richard,&rdquo;
  but at once retired on perceiving a numerous
  party of the enemy lying in ambush. The battle
  re-commenced, when the &ldquo;Alliance&rdquo; again raked
  the &ldquo;Serapis,&rdquo; inflicting dreadful slaughter, and
  bringing down the mainmast.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Serapis&rdquo; was little better than a wreck,
  and the old flag was reluctantly hauled down.
  Paul Jones received the conquered enemy most
  courteously. Without the aid of the &ldquo;Alliance&rdquo;
  the &ldquo;Bonne Homme Richard&rdquo; would have been
  captured. She was on fire in two places, the guns
  on her lower deck were dismounted, and she
  had seven feet of water in her hold. Out of
  her crew of 375 men, 306 were killed and
  wounded. The total loss of the two English
  ships did not reach half that number. On the
  following day the &ldquo;Bonne Homme Richard&rdquo;
  was abandoned, and, before all her wounded

  <p style="text-align: center"><i>The following are extracted from a number of favourable reviews of</i> <br />
    &ldquo;<b><span class="smcap">Yorkshire in the Olden Times</span>.&rdquo;</b></p>
  <p>The <i>Bury Free Press</i> says: &ldquo;The volume is one of wide and varied interest, which will
    secure for it readers in all parts of the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>Shields Daily Gazette</i> states: &ldquo;The work consists of a series of articles contributed
    by various authors, and it thus has the merit of bringing together much special
    knowledge from a great number of sources. It is an entertaining volume, full of interest
    for the general reader, as well as for the learned and curious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>Hornsea Gazette</i> concludes its notice by saying: &ldquo;The work is one which cannot
    fail to instruct and entertain the reader.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It is pronounced by the <i>Hull Examiner</i> &ldquo;a most readable and well-bound volume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Says the <i>Malton Gazette</i>: &ldquo;Unlike many books akin to it, this work contains nothing
    not of permanent and exclusive worth, and Mr. Andrews&rsquo; latest book is one which the
    future historian of the shire of many acres will be glad to avail himself of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>Christian Leader</i> finishes a long and favourable review as follows: &ldquo;The volume
    is one of diversified interest, likely to find readers in other parts of the country as well as
    in the great province to which it has particular reference.&rdquo;</p>
